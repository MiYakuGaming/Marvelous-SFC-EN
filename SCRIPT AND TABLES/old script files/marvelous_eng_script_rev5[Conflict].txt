[nl3]explore the island?
[en2]
Why don't you explore

It seems that if we

[nl3]make it rotate.[np]
[scl]But it's too heavy for
[scl]one person.
[en2]
Can't we move it
[nl2]somehow...?
[en2]
The powerful water

[en2]

[nl2]  More junk? Shucks.
[en2]
How can we lift such a
[nl2]large object...?
[en2]
If we lift from both

[nl3]maybe we can move it.
[en2]
You wanna piece of me?[np]

[scl]Also, there are lots

[nl3]I water dried out

[en2]
You saved a monkey,
[nl2]but bullied a dog.[np]
[nl3]Monkeys and dogs have
[scl]been rivals since
[scl]ancient times...[np]
[scl]However, I am a

Ooo ooo aah...[np]
[nl2]TL: Thank you,

[nl3]from the monkey![np]
[scl]Their colors match

[scl]strangely enough.[np]
[scl]What do these
[scl]keys open??
[en1]
I don't see any fish

[nl3]Let's get closer.[en2]
How 'bout we take a
[nl2]closer look.
[en2]

[nl2] Woooooooooosh~!
[en2]
Something's wrong.
[nl2]All of us need to line
[nl3]up behind the box.
[en1]
I didn't think so
[nl2]before, but maybe
[nl3]Miss Gina is this way?
[en2]
It looks like we can
[nl2]ride in it, but it
[nl3]only fits one person.
[en2]
It's fast! I guess we
[nl2]can't avoid them if
[nl3]we're together.
[en2]
But how can we get
[nl2]there...?
[en2]
Take a Look, sheriff!
[nl2]Have a piece of this!
[en1]
If we pull it like
[nl2]this, we won't be able
[nl3]to get back out.
[en2]
What? The sheriff
[nl2]was a plant?![np]
[nl3]But I'm the sheriff.[np]

I believe children

Don't worry, I haven't
[nl2]changed at all. Look,

How does this open...?
[en2]
Juuust kidding![np]

[scl]Start when you're
[scl]ready.

Something's not right.
[nl2]We'll need to position
[nl3]ourselves around the[np]
[scl]lever evenly or we
[scl]can't move it.
[en2]
Something's wrong.[np]
[nl2]All three of us need
[nl3]to line up in front
[scl]of the pipe.
[en2]
Hey there, tubs.
[nl2]I like husky kids.[np]
[nl3]This will probably be
[scl]a long journey, so
[scl]let's be friends.

[X$6A]It's a girl the

[en2]
[F2]Polly, the tiny girl, 
[nl2]became your friend?![np]
[nl3]She can help us in
[scl]places that are too
[scl]small for us.[np]
[scl]She seems a little
[scl]selfish...
[en1]
Dear [team] Team,
[nl2]How are your studies?[np]
[nl3]It seems Jim misjudged
[scl]you after all.[np]
[scl]His behavior after
[scl]Miss Gina's abduction
[scl]was presumptuous.[np]
[scl]Despite that, it 
[scl]would be for the best
[scl]if you were to return.[np]
[scl]You should either wait 
[scl]for the police,[np] 
[scl]or find a ship and 
[scl]leave that island.[np]
[scl]I wish you luck.
[scl]      ~Keep studying.

Chirpoo? Chirp.[np]
[nl2]TL: What's wrong?
[nl3]That will never work.[np]
[scl]The three of you
[scl]need to line up more
[scl]closely to it.
[en2]
If I stay here,
[nl2]another dog might try
[nl3]to eat me...[np]
[scl]...So my present to
[scl]you is to go along

[scl]I'll hitch a ride with

[SP$0339]You received [C$22][C$1E]
[nl2]Luck Rocks.
[nl3]It's a miracle!
[en1]
It might fall in if
[nl2]you pull it from
[nl3]above.
[en2]
...He looks sleepy.
[en2]
Why is a boat in a
[nl2]place like this...?
[en2]
Judging by it's looks,
[nl2]this ship seems pretty
[nl3]old.[np]
[scl]Like a pirate ship
[scl]from an old story.
[scl]This is so cool!
[en2]
It's a shame you can't
[nl2]see the front from
[nl3]here!
[en2]
I wonder how it
[nl2]works...?
[en2]
Okay, it's been oiled.
[en2]
That's pretty... huge!
[en2]
If you give me the
[nl2]treasure, she lives.[np]
[nl3]What'll it be?[X$6A]
[scl]    Fine, take it.
[scl]    Over my dead body![X$68]
[en1]
I'll just take the
[nl2]payment in advance.[np]
[nl3]Choose Luck Rocks from
[scl][C$4A] and then
[scl]press the [C$02] button.
[en2]
Okay, that's [num] Luck
[nl2]Rock! Which box do you
[nl3]want to open?[X$6A]
[en1]
[X$6A]    1 Left Chest
[nl2]    2 Middle Chest
[nl3]    3 Right Chest[X$6E]
[en1]
Hehehe, you're sure?[X$6A]
[nl2]    Sure.
[nl3]    Hold on.[X$68]
[en1]
Dang boy, are you ever
[nl2]dumb. You missed
[nl3]completely![np]
[scl]Give it another try?
[en1]
...Are you happy?
[nl2]Pathetic. Take your
[nl3][num] Luck Rock.
[en1]
[X$6A]Received [num]
[nl2]Luck Rock. Since you
[nl3]just gave one away,[np]
[scl]you don't feel too
[scl]happy about it.
[en1]
Heh, lucky guess.
[nl2]Here, take your
[nl3][X$6B] Luck Rocks.[np]
[scl]A man doesn't go back
[scl]on his word. But don't just
[scl]split after winning,[np]
[scl]give me a chance to
[scl]win it back.
[en1]
Bow wow woof![np]
[nl2]TL: Give twice as much
[nl3]pain as you take![np]
[scl]That's how dogs roll.
[scl]So I'm going to eat
[scl]you!
[en2]
These logs are tied
[nl2]down with rope...[np]
[nl3]I don't think they can
[scl]be moved.
[en2]
How dare you just
[nl2]barge in here without
[nl3]an appointment![np]
[scl]I'm a very busy man.
[scl]Come back later...
[en2]
Oh, you want to go
[nl2]deeper into the
[nl3]jungle?[np]
[scl]Well, I don't trust
[scl]you! This town is full
[scl]of delinquents...[np]
[scl]Earlier, a brat named
[scl]John stole the key![np]
[scl]If you want to unlock the
[scl]gate that badly,[np]
[scl]find John and get the
[scl]key from him.
[en2]
Huh... What's this?[np]
[nl2]Oh... the board is
[nl3]broken so we can't
[scl]read the phone number.
[en2]
Huh?... What's this?[np]
[nl2]「Do Not Enter. Direct

[SP$021A]Ooki! Ookii![np]

[scl]after we lost?[np]
[scl]
[scl]Well, you're right!
[scl]
[en1]
What on earth is in
[nl2]this?
[nl3]It's awfully heavy.
[en2]
If there's nothing
[nl2]behind it, the machine
[nl3]won't work?!

Is Deon really a
[nl2]coward? Look at his
[nl3]heart beating!

They even show up on

[SP$0138]It looks human!!

I see, I see. You kids

[nl3]with some research.[np]
[scl]Alright, lead the way!
[scl]...Aren't I a nice
[scl]guy?
[en1]
You're too fast!
[nl2]Show your elders some
[nl3]respect!
[en2]
[X$6A]He seems like
[nl2]he's guarding this
[nl3]place.
[en2]
It looks like there
[nl2]used to be a hole
[nl3]here...
[en2]
We sell the Baobab
[nl2]tree's oil in this
[nl3]village.[np]
[scl]Mr. Smith was the one
[scl]who discovered it.[np]
[scl]If you want to know
[scl]more,[np]
[scl]you should head East
[scl]to his house and ask
[scl]him personally.
[en2]
My baby is sleeping,
[nl2]don't you dare wake
[nl3]him up...
[en2]
Oh no, I'm sorry![np]
[nl2]Thanks to Mr. Smith,
[nl3]the villagers can make
[scl]a living selling oil,[np]
[scl]but lately, thieves
[scl]have been coming to
[scl]steal the tree oil.[np]
[scl]By the way, I'm
[scl]one of them.

John's just inside,

Huh!? You can see

Polly: Hey, small and

[scl]    Right, darling?
[en2]
Hehehe... Who is John?
[nl2]Don't look at me.
[nl3]John is over there!
[en2]
[SP$0319]Wash off your shame
[nl2]and try again!

Just kidding~!
[nl2]I AM John!
[nl3]Nuts, you found me.[np]
[scl]Fine, I'll give it
[scl]back. Let's play again
[scl]sometime!
[en1]
[F2]Received the Gate
[nl2]Key from John![np]
[nl3]But you get a lot of
[scl]keys, so it's not that
[scl]special anymore.
[en1]
But really, I just
[nl2]want to try an 「adult
[nl3]game.「
[en2]
There are various
[nl2]numbers.
[nl3]What could they be?
[en2]
...Should you try
[nl2]standing there?
[en2]
It looks like it might
[nl2]start moving... gross!
[en2]
Was this part of some
[nl2]experiment...?
[en2]
The ground is still
[nl2]wet here... [np]
[nl3]It must have broken
[scl]out recently.
[en2]
It's hard to see
[nl2]without getting
[nl3]closer.
[en2]
What happened to your
[nl2]friends?[np]
[nl3]Unless all 3 of you
[scl]are here, the ship
[scl]can't depart.
[en1]
[F2]We got the phone
[nl2]number for the

[scl]Just as I suspected!
[en1]
The guy with the key
[nl2]is... John...!?

Uhh...Which one is
[nl2]John!?
[en1]
It says...
[nl2] 1.Latin   3.Rock

Hmm~!...

Haha, you found me

My husband loves my

[scl]If you give him this
[scl]lunch I made, you can

[en2]
I went to the basement
[nl2]under this house to
[nl3]get to the cave,[np]
[scl]but the gate was
[scl]locked![np]
[scl]I'm pretty sure Mr.
[scl]Smith has the key
[scl]locked up in a safe...[np]
[scl]If you want to enter

[scl]I'll give you

[scl]Who is it turning

[scl]this.[np]
[scl]Still... It's better
[scl]than nothing, so I'll
[scl]give it to you.
[en1]
[F2]Received an Empty
[nl2]Water Bottle![np]
[nl3]This isn't a weapon
[scl]at all~![np]
[scl]It's really walking
[scl]the line of 「better
[scl]than nothing.「
[en1]
All 3 are the same
[nl2]switch.
[en2]
I won't tell outsiders
[nl2]anything about this
[nl3]town.
[en2]
It's too far to see
[nl2]what it is!
[en2]
Ohh, that looks
[nl2]delicious! What?
[nl3]You'll give it to me?[np]
[scl]Thanks! Mmmm...
[en1]
W-Water!!... Water!!
[nl2]Quick... Bring me
[nl3]water!!!
[en2]
Glug glug glug...

Okay, there are
[nl2]probably more of them,
[nl3]right?[np]
[scl]Listen closely to
[scl]what I'm about to tell
[scl]you.
[en2]
Why is it in here?
[en2]
It's locked and won't
[nl2]open.
[en2]
[F2]The gate opened![np]
[nl2]Now we can go into the
[nl3]cave!
[en1]
P...please forgive me!
[nl2]I'm not really from
[nl3]this island.[np]
[scl]I'm just a thief who
[scl]heard there was a
[scl]mysterious treasure[np]
[scl]on the island so I
[scl]came to steal it.[np]
[scl]I stole the key, but
[scl]in that room...[np]
[scl]There was some kind of
[scl]plant, and it...[np]
[scl]It turned into me..!
[scl]It was so scary!
[en1]
Thank you!
[nl2]You saved me![np]
[nl3]I'm in charge of this
[scl]village.
[scl]Call me Smith.[np]
[scl]I was studying the
[scl]parasite that attached
[scl]to the Baobab tree,[np]
[scl]and then it suddenly
[scl]turned into me...[np]
[scl]And then it attacked
[scl]me![np]
[scl]Oh! I have to destroy
[scl]the rest of the
[scl]parasite before it[np]
[scl]escapes and causes
[scl]more trouble!!
[en1]
No one from the
[nl2]village would come
[nl3]into this room.[np]
[scl]A thief must have come
[scl]in here and gotten
[scl]attacked by a plant!
[en1]
Please don't say that![np]
[nl2]Unless you do
[nl3]something, that
[scl]crystal ball will...[np]
[scl]Please, listen to me!
[scl]
[scl]
[en1]
You'll help me?!
[nl2]If you investigate all
[nl3]the villagers,[np]
[scl]I'm sure you can find
[scl]the criminal![np]
[scl]First, go find a man
[scl]named Mike.[np]
[scl]He knows how many
[scl]people live in the
[scl]village.[np]
[scl]Mike[SP$0121] gets scared at
[scl]the squeak of a mouse,[np]
[scl]so you'll probably
[scl]find the fraidy-cat at
[scl]his house.
[en2]
If you want to find
[nl2]out how many people
[nl3]live in the village,[np]
[scl]you should ask Mike.[np]
[scl]He's a coward who
[scl]can't bear to hear a
[scl]mouse's squeak,[np]
[scl]so he never leaves his
[scl]home.
[en2]
You want to know how
[nl2]many villagers there
[nl3]are?[np]
[scl]I'll only tell that
[scl]large boy in the
[scl]green...
[en2]
By the way... Don't
[nl2]say anything about my
[nl3]fear of mice, okay?[np]
[scl]You can have this.
[en1]
[F2]You received a
[nl2]village coin![np]
[nl3]Is his secret that big
[scl]of a deal?[np]
[scl][X$6A] If you lose that
[scl]coin, come back
[scl]anytime.[np]
[scl]But watch out for
[scl]Jackie, he'll take
[scl]your money!
[en1]
What? Another one?[np]
[nl2]Fine, but keep quiet
[nl3]about that other
[scl]thing, okay?
[en1]
I'll give you a coin
[nl2]whenever you need it,[np]
[nl3]but don't let anyone
[scl]know my secret.
[en2]
There's a small hole.
[en2]
It looks like a mouse
[nl2]hole!
[en2]
You need to get
[nl2]closer!
[en2]
Come on out, Mousey!
[nl2]Got some yummy cheeese
[nl3]for you~!

Squeak squeak...[np]
[nl2]TL: Meh, I've had
[nl3]better...

I can't do my job like
[nl2]this![np]
[nl3]Can you kids go inside
and persuade Mr. Smith
to let me back in?[X$6A][np]
[scl]    Fine.
[scl]    I don't wanna.[X$68]
[en1]
Thanks a ton! Come see
[nl2]me later and I'll give
[nl3]you a reward.[np]
[scl]Oh, I think there's a
[scl]lot of Luck Rocks in
[scl]the tree west of here.[np]
[scl]Okay, see you guys
[scl]later!
[en1]
Don't be like that![np]
[nl2]There's just a cute
[nl3]little dog inside, so
[scl]don't worry.[np]
[scl]I'm heading back to
[scl]the village now,[np]
[scl]but if you stop by
[scl]later, I'll give you a
[scl]reward![np]
[scl]
[scl] It's something nice!
[scl]
[en1]
[F2]You got the old,
[nl2]Holey Cheese![np]
[nl3]Only Max or a mouse
[scl]would consider this a
[scl]reward...
[en1]
If you don't have
[nl2]anything to say, then
[nl3]get out of here!
[en2]
He... He disappeared?!
[en2]
This dog...
[nl2]Seems kind of weird?!
[en2]
It's... It's moving!
[en2]
The inside of the
[nl2]collar says 「Socks.「[np]
[nl3]This must have been

[en2]
It's no good!

Hey, the ring is over
[nl2]there.
[en2]
Suddenly, the ship
[nl2]veers alongside!!!
[en2]
Phew, that was
[nl2]close...
[nl3][SP$0121]Eeh?
[en1]
...Why have you come
[nl2]here?!
[en2]
Thanks to you guys I'm

[nl3]Come with me to
[scl]fulfill your
[scl]punishment.
[en1]
I'm glad the princess
[nl2]came back,[np]
[nl3]but things have been
[scl]getting stranger and
[scl]stranger.[np]
[scl]Solomon seems a little
[scl]blue...
[en2]
Did you already talk
[nl2]to Solomon? He talks
[nl3]like a sissy,[np]
[scl]but he's one of the
[scl]best warriors in the

[en2]
There are all sorts of
[nl2]mysterious animals
[nl3]deep under the ground.[np]
[scl]Perhaps you criminals
[scl]will become a snack
[scl]for them... A pity.
[en2]
First that tomboy
[nl2]caused a ruckus by
[nl3]runnin' away from home[np]
[scl]and then she comes
[scl]strolling back in with
[scl]three criminals.[np]
[scl]Princess Polly is
[scl]quite a handful...
[en2]
I bet you were
[nl2]surprised when you saw
[nl3]the king, weren't you?[np]
[scl]This kingdom has
[scl]always been very hot.[np]
[scl]Why doesn't he take
[scl]off that heavy gown?
[en2]
Besides the 「Blue
[nl2]Things「 there are many
[nl3]gigantic bugs,[np]
[scl]but only the ants have
[scl]formed an army and
[scl]attacked our kingdom.
[en2]
Even if the ants want
[nl2]to attack, they can't-[np]
[nl3]thanks to the miracle
[scl]remedy, Ant Buster![np]
[scl]If I can complete it's
[scl]production, the Ant
[scl]Menace will be abated.[np]
[scl]
[scl]Which means, as your
[scl]punishment...[np]
[scl]You must search the
[scl]dangerous forest for
[scl]the ingredients.[np]
[scl]The princess says that
[scl]the three of you are
[scl]capable adventurers,[np]
[scl]able to handle any
[scl]challenge, so I'm
[scl]hoping for the best.[np]
[scl]Not only is this your
[scl]punishment, it is a
[scl]personal plea from me.[np]
[scl]I'm sure if you manage
[scl]to succeed,[np]
[scl]the king will reassess
[scl]your sentence.[np]
[scl]  Will you help me?[X$6A]
[scl]    Okay
[scl]    No way![X$68]
[en1]
I'm begging you.
[nl2]If you can help me
[nl3]make the Ant Buster,[np]
[scl]I'm sure the king will
[scl]forgive you.[np]
[scl]  Okay, or no way?[X$6A]
[scl]    Okay.
[scl]    No way![X$68]
[en1]
I'm terribly sorry to
[nl2]hear that.[np]
[nl3]In accordance to law,
[scl]you will be fed to the
[scl]ants.
[scl]...I really hate to do
[scl]it, but...
[scl]
[en1]
Well, aren't you brave
[nl2]little boys![np]
[nl3]Well then, I can't let
[scl]all three of you leave
[scl]together,[np]
[scl]but you can open the
[scl]gate on the right
[scl]there.
[en1]
The one who stays
[nl2]behind must stand in
[nl3]the middle of the cell[np]
[scl]on the lit-up block.
[scl]That will open and
[scl]close the gate.
[en2]
There are 5 things you
[nl2]need to get. Read the
[nl3]blackboard for detail.[np]
[scl]Make sure you remember
[scl]them properly.
[en2]
This small kingdom
[nl2]would be completely
[nl3]overwhelmed,[np]
[scl]if the ants attacked
[scl]tomorrow...
[en2]
Listen carefully to
[nl2]Hassan's sentence and
[nl3]repent your sins!
[en2]
If I don't get home
[nl2]soon, my mom will find
[nl3]out I'm not in bed,[np]
[scl]so later, dudes!!
[en1]
You must not run away.[np]
[nl2]If you do, anyone left
[nl3]behind will be fed to
[scl]the 「Blue Things.「
[en2]
You're going to the
[nl2]forest?[np]
[nl3]It might be better to
[scl]be eaten by the 「Blue
[scl]Things「...[np]
[scl]Err... I mean...
[scl]Nevermind.
[en2]
Princess Polly has
[nl2]retired to her
[nl3]chamber.[np]
[scl]If you wish to see
[scl]her, you need

[en2]
Solomon is running
[nl2]errands in town.[np]
[nl3]He's probably at the
[scl]artist Caesar O Enai's
[scl]house.
[en2]
More and more people
[nl2]are coming back from
[nl3]the forest injured.[np]
[scl]You kids should be

I... I almost died!...
[nl2]I'm staying away...[np]

A long time ago, this

[nl3]One night, most of the

That's the best piece

[scl]my back.[np]
[scl]If you think you can
[scl]take it, give it your
[scl]best shot![np]
[scl]I'm not a pushover

Fugo, fugo... Fuuugo.[np]

Fugo. Fugo, fuugo.[np]

Wanna sneak a peek?
[nl2]    O...okay.

If we anger the King
[nl2]again,[np]
[nl3]there's no telling
[scl]what the punishment
[scl]would be.
[en2]
How dare you!![np]
[nl2]You cretins have
[nl3]barged into my private
[scl]chambers and...[np]
[scl]
[scl]...Peeped me!!
[scl][np]
[scl]Where are my guards?!
[scl]Get out of here this
[scl]very instant!!
[en2]
Please get out of
[nl2]here... I'll lose my
[nl3]dignity as a King!
[en2]
[F2]Dooduduudeedun!
[nl2]You got the king's
[nl3]「Striped Underpants.「
[en1]
He must be hot wearing
[nl2]such a thick gown.
[en2]
It has blue and green
[nl2]stripes on it.
[nl3]It's pretty fancy.
[en2]
Start with Green Paint
[nl2]and then mix with Red,
[nl3]and you'll get Black![np]
[scl]If you start with Red
[scl]or something, you
[scl]won't get Black.
[en2]
The first color you
[nl2]paint determines the
[nl3]pattern.[np]
[scl]Red is 「polka dots,「
[scl]Blue is 「stripes,「 and
[scl]Green is 「checkers.「[np]
[scl]The reason... is a
[scl]mystery, even to me.
[scl][en2]
Eeeek![np]
[nl2]TL: I'm sorry, boss!
[nl3]Please don't kick me!

Ooo! Eeeek![np]

[scl]I would have been
[scl]better off with the

Round 1 goes to the

[nl3]a weakness?
[en2]
[SP$00D3]Sweet! The door
[nl2]is open now!
[en1]
It says:
[nl2]「Socks's house.「
[en2]
It's a combination
[nl2]lock, so we can't open
[nl3]it.
[en2]
This doesn't look like
[nl2]the work of a human!

[en2]
Sorry for what I said
[nl2]earlier.[np]
[nl3]It's just a leftover
[scl]from lunch, but take
[scl]this snack!
[en1]
If you don't have a
[nl2]key, just give up.
[en2]
It's going all the way
[nl2]to the top.
[en2]
Heeeeyyyy~~!
[nl2]Is any~~~one there~~?![np]
[nl3]If you grab, the

[en1]
We sprayed Ant Buster
[nl2]on the rope and all
[nl3]around the hole,[np]
[scl]but I still don't feel
[scl]very safe.
[en2]
Is the princess safe?
[nl2]She couldn't already
[nl3]be...
[en2]
Even though all those
[nl2]soldiers went down,[np]
[nl3]only one made it back
[scl]alive.[np]
[scl]The Ant Buster alone
[scl]isn't enough to win
[scl]this fight.
[en2]
You cant's see it
[nl2]anymore. It's fallen
[nl3]to the bottom.
[en2]
We finished the King's
[nl2]gown.[np]
[nl3]Maybe Polly's father
[scl]will change his mind
[scl]about us now.
[en2]
It goes allll the way
[nl2]to the top.
[en1]
The King's birthday is
[nl2]coming up in only 3
[nl3]day's time![np]
[scl]I need to finish his
[scl]portrait in time for
[scl]his birthday, or else![np]
[scl]But, woe is me, I was
[scl]out on a stroll when
[scl]all of the sudden,[np]
[scl]a gang of spiders from
[scl]the forest mugged me
[scl]and stole my paints![mp]
[scl]Oh, what will I do
[scl]now~?
[en2]
What are you doing?
[nl2]If you do anything
[nl3]suspicious,[np]
[scl]the soldiers will
[scl]arrest you again.
[en2]
The gown isn't
[nl2]finished yet.
[en2]
Wowzers! Those are the
[nl2]painting tools Caesar
[nl3]lost in the forest![np]
[scl]Go take them to Caesar
[scl]right away.
[en2]
Those are the paints I
[nl2]lost in the forest...[np]
[nl3]Thank you for finding
[scl]them for me...
[scl][np]
[scl]But, I'm gonna let you
[scl]go ahead and keep
[scl]them.[np]
[scl]According to my
[scl]calculations,[np]
[scl]overlapping two of
[scl]those paints will
[scl]finish this painting.[np]
[scl]The problem lies in
[scl]which order to use the
[scl]paints.[np]
[scl]My painting know-how
[scl]is in a book in the
[scl]castle archives.[np]
[scl]If you try to remember
[scl]what the king's gown
[scl]looks like,[np]
[scl]you could read the[np]
[scl]book and figure out
[scl]how to duplicate it...
[en2]
You can't paint like
[nl2]that.
[nl3][np]
[scl]You have to focus and
[scl]use all 3 at once.
[en2]
Unless you have all 3
[nl2]paints, we can't
[nl3]finish the painting.
[en2]
[SP$00D3]Who's gonna paint now?[np]
[nl2]Think of the king's
[nl3]gown and pick the
[scl]first color.[np]
[scl]    Deon - Red
[scl]    Jack - Blue
[scl]    Max  - Green[X$6E]
[en1]
Who's goes next?
[nl2]    Deon - Red
[nl3]    Jack - Blue[X$68]
[en1]
And then who?
[nl2]    Deon - Red
[nl3]    Max  - Green[X$68]
[en1]
Who's gonna go next?
[nl2]    Jack - Blue
[nl3]    Max  - Green[X$68]
[en1]
Close, but the design
[nl2]is wrong.
[nl3][np]
[scl]Go clear your head and
[scl]try again later.
[scl]
[en1]
It's... pitch black!!
[nl2]Didn't you read my
[nl3]painting book?[np]
[scl]Go take a breather and
[scl]try again later.
[scl]
[en1]
Don't forget to paint
[nl2]two layers.
[en2]
Stop it right there!
[nl2]
[nl3][np]
[nl2]Even if you paint on
[nl3]top of that, there's
[scl]no way to fix it![np]
[scl]Leave and come back
[scl]later.
[scl][en2]
[F2]It's beautiful~!
[nl2]Wonderful! Marvelous![np]
[nl3]That's the king's gown
[scl]I remember!
[en1]
Good work. I'll go
[nl2]inform the king, so
[nl3]come along afterward.[np]
[scl]I'm sure the king will
[scl]be very pleased.
[en1]
You might even be
[nl2]better than me...
[nl3][np]
[scl]But don't go getting
[scl]any crazy ideas.
[scl][np]
[scl]Don't go dropping out
[scl]out of school to
[scl]become a painter.[np]
[scl]There's just no money
[scl]in it, you know.

[nl3]You're gonna need to

[en2]
Don't go spreading
[nl2]this around, but Jim
[nl3]is really reckless,[np]
[scl]so a feint can beat
[scl]him. To fake him out,
just switch leaders.
[en2]
Use [C$0A] to change

Haha, that was fun.

[scl]some fish, Dorothy's

[scl]Sorry, but could you
[scl]get some fish for us?[np]
[scl]Press START and equip
[scl]the fishing rod, then
[scl]press [C$04] to use it.[np]
[scl]Got it?
[en1]
To pull in a fish, you

[scl]You have to gently
[scl]apply the [C$08], okay?
[en2]
When you cast the rod,

Oh! I'm alive! I hate
[nl2]to say it, but Polly
[nl3]fell into enemy hands.[np]
[scl]Hurry back to the
[scl]castle to prepare for
[scl]our next offensive.
[en1]
Thank you. They caught
[nl2]me by surprise. I need
[nl3]to go back now.
[en1]
There are still
[nl2]injured soldiers
[nl3]ahead![np]
[scl]Let's keep going.
[en1]
Take THIS!-- And THAT!
[nl2]I can handle this guy
[nl3]on my own...
[en1]
[X$6A]
[nl2] Geh!
[en1]
[X$6A]The medicine
[nl2]fell down the hole.[np]
[nl3]There's no one else

[scl]soldiers.[np]
[scl]You are their only

[scl][np]
[scl]I can get back to the

[nl2]...What should I do!?
[en2]
I'm in your debt.
[nl2]What? Princess Polly
[nl3]is...?![np]
[nl3]I'll leave it to you
[scl]kids.
[scl]
[en1]
The dirt seems softer
[nl2]here...
[nl3]Hmm...[np]
[scl]Maybe we can dig a
[scl]hole with 「that「?
[en2]
...It's too hard to
[nl2]dig here.
[en1]

[nl2] Hm? Waaaaah!
[en1]
Huh? Nothing's written
[nl2]here.
[en2]
I can't even find the
[nl2]keyhole...
[nl3][np]
[scl]How are we supposed to
[scl]open this?
[en2]
It looks sort of like
[nl2]a fish and sort of
[nl3]like a lever.[np]
[scl]I wonder if we can
[scl]give it a pull with
[scl]something...?
[en2]
I wonder if this will
[nl2]move.
[en2]
Black 2, white 3, and
[nl2]then black 1.

D...Damn it!
[nl2]You'll pay for this!

Hassan, what are you
[nl2]saying?!
[nl3][np]
[scl]I don't want to just
[scl]sit here and waste my
[scl]time waiting to die![np]
[scl]If we wait, they'll
[scl]come again tonight and
[scl]destroy our kingdom![np]
[scl]Hurry up and give me
[scl]that Buster Cannon!
[scl]
[en1]
I understand.[np]
[nl2]If you've made up your
[nl3]mind, I won't try to
[scl]stop you.[np]
[scl]I'll stand watch over

[en1]
Good answer![np]
[nl2]Alright, all [C$24] of you
[nl3]need to gather around
[scl]and take our spots.[np]
[scl]Once you're all in
[scl]position, push [C$02] on
[scl]the [C$48] on the side.[np]
[scl]Okay everyone, get
[scl]back.
[scl][np]
[scl]Let's see [team] Team's
[scl][C$48]!
[en1]
...What are you
[nl2]saying?...
[nl2]You're coming with me!
[en1]
We can't lift this
[nl2]heavy pot.
[en2]
How 'bout we each get
[nl2]on a different side?
[nl3][np]
[nl3]If the [C$24] of us work
[scl]together, we should be
[scl]able to lift it. ~
[en2]
When it's too big a
[nl2]job for one person,[np]
[nl3]gather your team
[scl]around and use [C$48]!
[en2]
Some items are used
[nl2]from the [C$4A] menu.[np]
[nl3]Other items are
[scl]equipped from the menu
[scl]and used with [C$04]...[np]
[scl]Did you know that?
[en2]
You can find out lots
[nl2]of things by using [C$46]!
[en2]
You can't just yank on
[nl2]it, boy![np]
[nl3]Press [C$08] gently after
[scl]a fish bites.
[scl]Nice and easy...!
[en2]
Look at that geek over
[nl2]there, trying to boss
[nl3]me around![np]
[scl]He says it's because
[scl]Miss Gina made him a
[scl]leader...[np]
[scl]But honestly, how can
[scl]I take orders from
[scl]him?[np]
[scl]His face is tiny, and
[scl]his head is huge!
[scl][en2]
That egghead is sayin'
[nl2]he's in charge while
[nl3]Miss Gina's gone.[np]
[scl]What a little turd.
[en2]
...How do you move it
[nl2]again?
[en2]
Jim is still missing...
[nl2]I hope Miss Gina comes
[nl3]back soon.[np]
[scl]Who even cares about
[scl]Jim?! ...
[scl]
[en1]
Dear stinky brats,
[nl2]You guys suck.[np]
[nl3]Don't think you'll get
[scl]away with lifting my
[scl]treasure.[np]
[scl]So, I'm keeping an eye
[scl]on your smokin'
[scl]hot teacher.[np]
[scl]If you ever want to
[scl]see her again,[np]
[scl]come to the valley
[scl]past the lake.[np]
[scl]Don't forget my
[scl]Crystal Ball![np]
[scl] -The Greatest Pirate
[scl]  Under the Sky,
[scl]  King Blue
[en2]
B...But... Oh,
[nl2]Princess! Wait![np]
[nl3]Don't forget this
[scl]Super 「Buster Cannon「!
[en1]
It seems like
[nl2]something wild was
[nl3]going on back there.[np]
[scl]What could it have
[scl]been?
[en2]
It's probably a lift
[nl2]leading to the other
[nl3]side.
[en2]
S... Someone!
[nl2]Miss Gina was...
[nl3]Taken by pirates!![np]
[scl]What do we do, [team]
[scl]Team?!
[en1]
It's no use, he can't
[nl2]hear us.
[nl3]Let's get closer.
[en2]
Miss Gina is in
[nl2]trouble!! ...What?
[nl3]You already know?[np]
[scl]They're holding her
[scl]hostage?[np]
[scl]They may be tiny, but
[scl]they seem serious.
[scl][np]
[scl]They busted up this
[scl]gate and headed to the
[scl]valley.[np]
[scl]What are you waiting
[scl]for?
[scl][np]
[scl]Hurry up and untie me!
[scl]
[en1]
Without a key, it
[nl2]looks impossible to
[nl3]remove...
[en2]
Found a key!!
[en2]
Squeak, squeak![np]
[nl2]TL: If you yank on it
[nl3]so fast, it doesn't
[scl]hurt~!!
[en2]
The fat one is lifting
[nl2]the tall one and the
[nl3]small one...[np]
[scl]Were there pirates
[scl]who looked like us way
[scl]back then?!
[en2]
En-er-gy. Drained...
Pfffftt...  Re-gret!!
[en2]
Nope, it's way too
[nl2]tall to reach!
[en2]
Teamwork takes all 3
[nl2]of us!
[en2]
If we work together,
[nl2]we can even reach high
[nl3]places!
[en1]
So... So heavy![np]
[nl2]Max! Let's think this
[nl3]through before you
[scl]squish someone.
[en1]
If we work together...
[nl2]Haha! We did it!
[en1]
Wow! A treasure chest
[nl2]came out!
[en1]
Come on! You can't
[nl2]remove them from over
[nl3]there!
[en2]
T...Thank you so much,
[nl2][team] Team! I'm sorry
[nl3]I've been such a jerk.[np]
[scl]From now on, I swear
[scl]to turn over a new
[scl]leaf...[np]
[scl]
[scl]      ...Not!
[scl]
[en1]
[team] Team, come
[nl2]closer.
[en2]
You are a
[nl2]「very marvelous「 team
[nl3]      The End!
[en1]
So you did have the
[nl2]Crystal Ball![np]
[nl3]That will lead
[scl]us straight to
[scl]「Maverick's Treasure.「[np]
[scl]Now, it will finally
[scl]be mine![np]
[scl]Patchies, place the
[scl]ball over there.
[en1]
Just you wait, the
[nl2]treasure will soon be
[nl3]ours!
[en1]
Even if you jump, it's
[nl2]too far... If only
[nl3]this box weren't here.
[en2]
Forgive me,
[nl2]Patchies...
[en2]
After they put the
[nl2]ball there, it started
[nl3]glowing...[np]
[scl]And the door...[np]
[scl]Miss Gina!
[scl]What happened to her!?
[scl]
[en2]
Isn't there a switch
[nl2]nearby?
[en2]
Some little kid
[nl2]showing off cuz he's
[nl3]taller than I am![np]
[scl]I won't let you go any
[scl]further!
[en2]
Leave us the ball and
[nl2]get out of here!
[nl3][np]
[scl]With that treasure,
[scl]we can live out our
[scl]lives in luxury!
[en2]
You stole the Crystal
[nl2]Balls we were looking
[nl3]for...[np]
[scl]You took the keys
[scl]we wanted...
[scl][np]
[scl]Seriously, you guys
[scl]are worse than any
[scl]pirates I know!!
[en2]
Your teacher is quite
[nl2]a foxy lady. Our
[nl3]leader is ugly as sin.[np]
[scl]We're a little jealous
[scl]of you guys...
[scl]
[en2]
We'll get run over if
[nl2]we get too close...
[nl3]What should we do?
[en2]
The door is actually
[nl2]not very strong.
[nl3]That means...
[en2]
Ugh...[np]
[nl2]I can't take slamming
[nl3]up against this over
[scl]and over...[np]
[scl]It's really starting
[scl]to smart.
[en2]
You can't lift it
[nl2]alone...
[en2]
...There seems to be a
[nl2]trick to making it
[nl3]work.
[en2]
Let's get some speed
[nl2]and BOOM! Smash it!
[en1]
What's this...[np]
[nl2]「WE'RE SORRY!
[nl3]You're stuck here
[scl]forever, nerds!「[np]
[scl]Sarcastic AND rude!...
[scl]Humpfh!...
[scl]
[en2]
It says 「Sisko's
[nl2]House.「 But the door
[nl3]is locked...
[en2]
No one seems to be
[nl2]home.
[en2]
Let's hurry up and get
[nl2]the Crystal Ball and
[nl3]get out of here!
[en2]
...Kweh kweh![np]
[nl2]TL: ...These guys seem
[nl3]suspicious!

Fugo. Fugo. Fugo![np]
[nl2]TL: Come here!

You guys are an

[en1]
You guys are a 「not

But what a terrible
[nl2]story...

Feelin' lucky?
[nl2]Just try to get past!
[en2]
...This is just a
[nl2]feeling, but...
[nl3][np]
[scl]Aren't some of the
[scl]soldiers from the
[scl]castle missing?
[en2]
Hassan took the
[nl2]finished Ant Buster
[nl3]and left.[np]
[scl]He said he had to make
[scl]it stronger somehow...
[scl][np]
[scl]I think he went to
[scl]Princess Polly's room.

All of our woes are
[nl2]due to those damned

He seemed to be a good

[F2]You received a Dog
[nl2]Bone![np]
[nl3]What a peculiar
[scl]sheriff~!

We thought there was
[nl2]treasure in here so we
[nl3]came in.[np]
[scl]Then the door closed
[scl]and we were trapped!
[scl][np]
[scl]So what, you still
[scl]haven't found the
[scl]treasure?[np]
[scl]I don't want to get
[scl]hit by any more
[scl]lightning...[np]
[scl]So later gators!

If you have something

[scl]Please save my boy!

There's lots of

[scl]You should take a good
[scl]look around.
[scl]
[en2]
No two ways about it,
[nl2]this is a pirate!
[en2]
My late husband was
[nl2]the spitting image of
[nl3]grandpa here.[np]
[scl]The pirate blood runs
[scl]thick.
[en2]
Who is that pretty
[nl2]lady with that tough-
[nl3]looking kid?
[en2]
Oh, stop it, it's me
[nl2]when I was younger,
[nl3]of course![np]
[scl]I haven't changed that
[scl]much, have I?
[en2]
This's my only son,
[nl2]Blue.[np]
[nl3]He left town to try to
[scl]become a pirate just
[scl]like his father.[np]
[scl]This was long ago...
[scl]I wonder what he's
[scl]doing now...[np]
[scl]I hope he hasn't been
[scl]killed on some far
[scl]away island...
[en2]
We should take this
[nl2]child home right away.[np]
[nl3]I'm sure his mother is
[scl]worried.
[en1]
The people in town are
[nl2]all liars![np]
[nl3]Miss Sisko isn't a bad
[scl]person at all![np]
[scl]You've gotta believe
[scl]me![np]
[scl]You guys try talking
[scl]to her, too.[np]
[scl]I'm sure you'll be
[scl]able to see that she
[scl]isn't a bad person.
[en1]
The crow in the
[nl2]cemetery is guarding
[nl3]my father's grave.[np]
[scl]If he sees these
[scl]flowers, I'm sure
[scl]he'll remember me.
[en2]
Will you listen to
[nl2]what I have to say?
[en2]
I should be the one to
[nl2]do it...[np]
[nl3]But when I think of
[scl]the townspeople...[np]
[scl]I can't go outside.
[en2]
It's so sad... The
[nl2]child is in shock and
[nl3]can't say the truth.
[en2]
Miss Sisko is a nice
[nl2]person, see?
[en2]
Y'all really saved
[nl2]the day.
[en2]
[X$6A]As long as this crow
[nl2]is here, we can't get
[nl3]near the tombstone...
[en2]
It's the tombstone for
[nl2]Christopher Benson.
[en2]
There's a gap in the
[nl2]stone here... I think
[nl3]something's inside...
[en2]
From here you can't
[nl2]tell what it is.

Caw, caw![np]

If you want to check

[nl3]the East of here...[np]
[scl]An old lady is living
[scl]next door, so it's
[scl]easy to find.
[en2]
For bandits to steal
[nl2]「Treasure「 from
[nl3]pirates...[np]
[scl]It sounds like a bad
[scl]joke...

How can this be the
[nl2]only water left in
[nl3]town!?[np]
[scl]If only I could turn
[scl]back the hands of

[scl]I definitely should

Grr... Ruff! Ruff![np]
[nl2]TL: This way leads to

What a spoiled dog!
[en2]
Where did you get this
[nl2]picture?[np]
[nl3]Everyone in this town
[scl]oughta recognize these
[scl]guys...
[en2]
It's the legendary
[nl2]pirate Christopher
[nl3]Benson, isn't it?[np]
[scl]He tried to take back
[scl]the 「town's treasure「
[scl]and died doing it.[np]
[scl]He was buried in the
[scl]cemetery outside of
[scl]town.
[en2]
Indio was leading the
[nl2]bandits!![np]
[nl3]It's his fault they
[scl]attacked us, our water
[scl]dried up,[np]
[scl]and now nothing will
[scl]go our way.
[en2]
We called this the
[nl2]「town's treasure.「[np]
[nl3]The legendary pirate, 
[scl]Christopher Benson,
[scl]once spoke of this...[np]
[scl]He said that it could
[scl]be used to find the
[scl]Maverick's Treasure.[np]
[scl]It's said the treasure
[scl]was hidden on some
[scl]other island...[en2]
I know the guys in
[nl2]this picture all too
[nl3]well.
[en2]
It's Benson, yeah?[np]
[nl2]He was a good guy,
[nl3]but got taken in by
[scl]Indio.[np]
[scl]He said he could
[scl]use it to make a time
[scl]machine.[np]
[scl]Benson let Indio
[scl]borrow the 「town's
[scl]treasure「,[np]
[scl]but he got hoodwinked
[scl]by a master of
[scl]deception!
[en2]
This is Indio, the
[nl2]leader of the bandits,
[nl3]right?[np]
[scl]He tricked Benson with
[scl]promises of a 「time
[scl]machine「,[np]
[scl]and then the bandits
[scl]made off with the
[scl]「town's treasure.「
[en2]
Now that Indio's dead,
[nl2]no one knows where the
[nl3]Crystal Ball is at.[np]
[scl]If you really want to
[scl]know so badly,[np]
[scl]make yourself a time
[scl]machine!
[en2]
I sort of recognize
[nl2]these people, but
[nl3]maybe not...
[en2]
Didn't this guy say
[nl2]「With Indio's help, I
[nl3]can time travel,「[np]
[scl]or something crazy
[scl]like that...?
[en2]
A long time ago, Indio
[nl2]fabricated outlandish
[nl3]stories.[np]
[scl]He said he could use
[scl]the 「town's treasure「 
[scl]for a time machine...[np]
[scl]They couldn't have
[scl]been true stories,

This crystal was the
[nl2]「town's treasure「 to
[nl3]us,[np]
[scl]but to Indio it was a
[scl]piece of a time
[scl]machine.
[en2]
Wow, take a look at
[nl2]this picture!
[en2]
It's the legendary
[nl2]pirate Benson, isn't
[nl3]it?
[en2]
This guy is Indio...[np]
[nl2]The guy who fooled the
[nl3]legendary pirate
[scl]Benson, right?[np]
[scl]Indio filled Benson's
[scl]head with lies,[np]
[scl]but got caught trying
[scl]to make his escape.
[en2]
If you can find 4 of
[nl2]these Crystal Balls,[np]
[nl3]it's rumored they'll
[scl]unlock a marvelous
[scl]treasure...[np]
[scl]Benson found this one
[scl]and we kept it as the
[scl]「town's treasure.「
[en2]
This is quite an old
[nl2]photograph...
[en2]
This man's wife lives
[nl2]next to the giant
[nl3]house in the East end.
[en2]
This man is the father
[nl2]of the girl who lives
[nl3]in 「Death Lake.「
[en2]
Only Indio knew where
[nl2]to find the 「town's
[nl3]treasure.「[np]
[scl]But dead men tell no
[scl]tales.
[en2]
What is this
[nl2]photograph?!
[en2]
Oh my, what a hunk.
[en2]
Ohoho, this is another
[nl2]fine man.
[nl3]Who could it be?
[en2]
What a pretty jewel.
[en2]
That's an old
[nl2]picture...
[en2]
I don't know...
[en2]
I don't know who it
[nl2]is...
[nl3]But his eyes look just
[scl]like Miss Sisko's!
[en2]
No idea...
[en2]
This picture was very
[nl2]special to my father.
[en2]
My father told me he
[nl2]had made a time
[nl3]machine.[np]
[scl]He used it to try to
[nl3]make this man believe[np]
[scl]that the water would
[scl]dry up in this town.
[en2]
It's my father, Indio.
[nl2]He said he could
[nl3]travel through time.
[en2]
The people of this
[nl2]town believe this is a
[nl3]special item.[np]
[scl]They believe it leads
[scl]to an even greater
[scl]treasure.[np]
[scl]But to us, it's really
[scl]a component of the
[scl]「time machine.「
[en2]
Oh wow, what are you
[nl2]doing with that photo?
[en2]
This is my husband
[nl2]when he was younger.[np]
[nl3]His name was
[scl]Christopher Benson.[np]
[scl]He once said, 「I found
[scl]someone who can build
[scl]a time machine.「[np]
[scl]He was quite convinced
[scl]that it was true, but
[scl]he had been deceived!
[en2]
When I met him, he
[nl2]didn't seem the type to
[nl3]steal things...
[en2]
My husband found a
[nl2]Crystal Ball.[np]
[nl3]He said that it was
[scl]supposed to lead to an
[scl]even greater treasure.[np]
[scl]Later, my son left
[scl]home in search of the
[scl]same Crystal Ball.
[en2]
[SP$0121]Where did
[nl2]you find this photo?![np]
[nl3]Have you shown it to
[scl]anyone else?[np]
[scl]Keep this a secret,
[scl]but listen to me:[np]
[scl]Indio really did make
[scl]a time machine.[np]
[scl]The 「Time Room「 he
[scl]used is in the locked
[scl]up mansion.[np]
[scl]I don't know how he
[scl]did it,[np]
[scl]but here is a message
[scl]that Indio left
[scl]behind.
[en1]
The old lady over
[nl2]there should have the
[nl3]key to the mansion.
[en2]
Dang it, how could all
[nl2]the water dry up![np]
[nl3]I should have listened
[scl]to Indio and dug more
[scl]wells...
[en2]
[SP$0121]There are 3
[nl2]clocks... The first
[nl3]one is at 10:00.[np]
[scl]The next one, at 9:30,
[scl]and the last one is at
[scl]10:30...[np]
[scl]
[scl]10:00, 9:30, 10:30...
[scl][en2]
I'll lend you the key,
[nl2]so come over here.
[en2]
Now you can enter the
[nl2]mansion.
[en1]
[F2]Received the Mansion
[nl2]Key![np]
[nl3]Now you can enter the
[scl]「Time Room「!
[en1]
Even now, when I look
[nl2]at that mansion,[np]
[nl3]I can still feel my
[scl]husband's presence...
[scl]So I can't go in...
[en2]
...Farewell...
[nl2]And thank you!
[en1]
You sure about that?
[en2]
You're really sure
[nl2]about that?
[en2]
The oldest one is to
[nl2]the left of the
[nl3]youngest one.[np]
[scl]The youngest one is to 
[scl]the right of the
[scl]middle one.[np]
[scl]The middle one is to
[scl]the left of the
[scl]youngest one.[np]
[scl]If you figure it out,
[scl]go from the oldest and
[scl]point at us in order!
[en2]
[SP$020D]Not even close!
[nl2]Is that your best
[nl3]shot?[np]
[scl]The oldest one is to
[scl]the left of the
[scl]youngest one.[np]
[scl]The youngest one is to 
[scl]the right of the
[scl]middle one.[np]
[scl]The middle one is to
[scl]the left of the
[scl]youngest one.[np]
[scl]If you figure it out,
[scl]go from the oldest and
[scl]point at us in order!
[en1]
The guard in front of
[nl2]Princess Polly's room
[nl3]is gone.[np]
[scl]I wonder what happened
[scl]here...[np]
[scl]Now anyone can come
[scl]and go as they please.
[en2]
I wonder what will be
[nl2]made in this pot.[np]
[nl3]I can't wait to find
[scl]out!
[en2]
Is lunch ready yet?[np]
[nl2]What is Dorothy
[nl3]planning on making,
[scl]anyway?
[en2]
The King's hobby is
[nl2]gardening.[np]
[nl3]Supposedly, there is a
[scl]magnificent garden
[scl]behind the castle...[np]
[scl]But I've never
[scl]actually seen it.
[scl]
[en2]
It doesn't seem too
[nl2]heavy.
[en2]
I never thought I'd
[nl2]see you all again. I'm
[nl3]so glad I was wrong.[np]
[scl]You must have had a
[scl]hard time coming all
[scl]the way here.[np]
[scl]Mr. Arnold? I see, Mr.
[scl]Arnold came to help
[scl]out. That's good.[np]
[scl]Let's get out of here.
[scl]According to what the
[scl]Patchies said,[np]
[scl]the only way out is to
[scl]use the elevator behind
[scl]the blue door.[np]
[scl]I found a blue box in
[scl]here...
[scl][np]
[scl]I bet the key to the
[scl]elevator door is
[scl]inside.[np]
[acl]But no matter
[scl]what I did, I couldn't
[scl]open it.[np]
[scl]Can you boys do
[scl]something with it?
[en1]
I wonder what's for
[nl2]lunch~.
[en2]
What? Lunch is another
[nl2]tomato dish!?[np]
[nl3]You came all the way
[scl]here just to tell me
[scl]that?[np]
[scl]Well, aren't you nice
[scl]boys.
[scl]
[en2]
You guys are pretty
[nl2]nice.
[en2]
Bzzt! Wrong item,
[nl2]Deon!
[en2]
Come on, Deon, you
[nl2]know better than that.
[en2]
Using that item makes
[nl2]no sense, Jack.
[en2]
Did you open the 3
[nl2]types of treasure
[nl3]chest in the ship?[np]
[scl]The place to use the
[scl]Small Key is west of
[scl]the ship.
[en1]
There are 4 handles
[nl2]that extend outward
[nl3]from the switch.[np]
[scl]Each time you move one
[scl]position in any
[scl]direction,[np]
[scl]the numbers will
[scl]change.
[scl][np]
[scl]Turning to the Right
[scl](右) will cause White
[scl]numbers to appear.[np]
[scl]Turning to the Left
[scl](左) will cause Black
[scl]numbers to appear.[np]
[scl]If the levers are
[scl]turned too far in any
[scl]direction,[np]
[scl]the number will be
[scl]reset, understand?
[scl][np]
[scl]If you want another 
[scl]tip, I'll need [num] more
[scl]Luck Rock from you.[np]
[scl] What do you say?[X$6A][np]
[scl]    Tell me more.
[scl]    Nah, I got it.[X$68]
[en1]
I'll tell you the
[nl2]correct way to rotate
[nl3]it...[np]
[scl]Right [C$22] times,
[scl]Left [C$28] times, and
[scl]Right [C$26] times.[np]
[scl]...I'm pretty sure
[scl]that was it.
[en1]
Did you find a lever
[nl2]in the cave shaped
[nl3]like a fish?[np]
[scl]Speaking of fish...
[scl]Now you get it, right?
[scl]
[en1]
It's almost lunch
[nl2]time, so let's head
[nl3]back!
[en1]
Jim is in trouble
[nl2]across the river!
[nl3][np]
[scl]We need the key that
[scl]the fish ate.
[scl][np]
[scl]Look closely to see
[scl]which fish ate it!
[scl][en1]
Try using your 「Mitt
[nl2]and Ball「 on things in
[nl3]your way!
[en1]
Are you stuck with the
[nl2]pipe?[np]
[nl3]Did you know a short
[scl]enough kid can fit
[scl]inside?
[en1]
Is there a better way?
[nl2]If you think of one,
[nl3]tell me, okay?
[en2]
We have to get this
[nl2]child home...[np]
[nl3]I'm sure his mother is
[scl]worried!
[en2]
Thank you, my father
[nl2]loved this flower.[np]
[nl3]If you show it to the
[scl]crow, I'm sure he'll
[scl]remember me.
[en1]
I was an idiot for
[nl2]asking [team] Team.
[nl3][np]
[nl3]From now on, I'm
[scl]calling you Sissy
[scl]Team.
[en2]
Soccer is getting
[nl2]boring.
[en2]
Let's do it again
[nl2]sometime.
[en2]
Don't let Jim know we
[nl2]told you, but...
[nl3][np]
[scl]He has a crush on Miss[np]
[scl]Gina!
[scl]
[en2]
If only you had some
[nl2]「Soccer Shoes「...
[nl3][np]
[scl]With 「Soccer Shoes,「
[nl3]you could kick this
[scl]ball like a champ...
[en2]
Why is this mansion
[nl2]the only locked
[nl3]building?
[en2]
[F2]The door opened![np]
[nl2]Where could the
[nl3]「Time Room「 be?
[en2]
I can still recall a
[nl2]little bit about the
[nl3]town's history.
[en2]
Caw caw![np]
[nl2]TL: You guys are
[nl3]alright.
[en2]
My dog falls straight
[nl2]asleep after eating,
[nl3]so don't worry.
[en1]
This is my husband's
[nl2]grandfather.
[en1]
This is...
[en1]
Instead of a ghost, I
[nl2]wish a sprout would
[nl3]come out...
[en2]
A ghost wouldn't come
[nl2]out in the daytime~.
[en2]
A... A shadow...!
[en2]
I wonder if he's
[nl2]really here?
[en2]
Even if he's a ghost,
[nl2]he's awfully shy...
[en2]
I've always been bad
[nl2]with ghosts and
[nl3]frogs....
[en2]
Indio's daughter must
[nl2]be behind this!
[en2]
It's a little scary,
[nl2]but exciting, too!
[en2]
Shall we give him a
[nl2]shake...?
[en2]
It's not that I don't
[nl2]trust you...
[nl3][np]
[scl]I made a promise not
[scl]to disclose any
[scl]personal information.[np]
[scl]Especially not my
[scl]name, or where I came
[scl]from.
[en2]
What's that picture?
[nl2]It's too far for me to
[nl3]see it well...
[en2]
Hey, it's me and
[nl2]Indio!
[nl3][np]
[scl]I don't remember
[scl]having this picture
[scl]taken...[np]
[scl]
[scl]Just who are you kids?
[scl][en1]
What in tarnation!?
[nl2]The 「Blue Crystal「 was
[nl3]stolen by bandits?![np]
[scl]How do you know?! If
[scl]that's true, we're in
[scl]serious trouble![np]
[scl]I know where the
[scl]hideout of the
[scl]「Mammoth Brothers「 is,[np]
[scl]so let's go save
[scl]Indio![np]
[scl]I'll take that picture
[scl]if you don't mind.
[scl][en2]
Let's hurry!
[en2]
Watch this!!
[en1]
We should be able to
[nl2]enter through here.
[nl3]Hurry!
[en1]
Come over here.
[en2]
Maybe if we search
[nl2]somewhere else I'll
[nl3]remember.
[en1]
Won't you try sailing
[nl2]the seven seas as a
[nl3]pirate?
[en2]
What kind of joke is
[nl2]it for bandits to
[nl3]attack pirates?
[en2]
Why don't you see for
[nl2]yourself?
[en2]
Blue!
[nl2]Behave yourself!!
[en2]
My mommy is pretty,
[nl2]isn't she?
[en2]
When I get older, I
[nl2]want to be a teacher!
[en2]
What kind of bird egg
[nl2]is this...?
[nl3]...What?!
[en1]
[F2]A baby crow hatched!
[en2]
Wow! Cool!
[en1]
I wonder how to make
[nl2]the flower open up...
[en2]
Maybe a good kick will
[nl2]do the trick!
[en2]
If you get too close,
[nl2]the thorns will poke
[nl3]you...
[en2]
Well blast me
[nl2]barnacles![np]
[nl3]The time warp worked!
[scl]Indio was telling the
[scl]truth![np]
[scl]So I've come to the
[scl]future...?[np]
[scl]Did the water really
[scl]dry up like Indio
[scl]said?!
[en1]
This Crystal Ball will
[nl2]lead us to the
[nl3]legendary treasure![np]
[scl]Doesn't sound like
[scl]you'll be needing this
[scl]anymore, does it?[np]
[scl]Sorry, but we'll be
[scl]taking it, then!!
[scl]
[en1]
We'll just let the
[nl2]townspeople handle the
[nl3]rest.[np]
[scl]
[scl]Look forward to it!
[scl]
[en1]
Press the [C$04] button
[nl2]to punch, hold it to
[nl3]guard! Okay!?
[en1]
Hehehe, later!
[en1]
The 「town's treasure「
[nl2]is gone![np]
[nl3]You stole it, didn't
[scl]you, Indio?![np]
[scl]I just received an 
[scl]anonymous tip about
[scl]you!
[en1]
You're under arrest!
[en1]
Thanks for assisting
[nl2]in the arrest, boys.
[nl3][np]
[scl]Now we know that Indio
[scl]is the leader of the
[scl]mountain bandits.
[en1]
Wow! You opened it!
[nl2]That key will probably
[nl3]open the blue door...[np]
[scl]Let's go there right
[scl]away.
[scl]
[en1]
...Isn't there another
[nl2]way to look inside?
[en2]
Without getting much
[nl2]closer, you can't see.
[en2]
[X$6A]Oh, there they are!
[nl2]What are they talking
[nl3]about?
[en2]
I didn't steal the
[nl2]crystal ball! I swear!
[nl3]But more importantly,[np]
[scl]we need to dig more
[scl]wells or the town will
[scl]run out of water![np]
[scl]I asked the boy at the
[scl]lake to dig the
[scl]holes...[np]
[scl]Can you find him and
[scl]help him?[np]
[scl]Unless those wells get
[scl]dug, and get dug fast,[np]
[scl]the town will be in
[scl]huge trouble!
[en2]
The town will run out
[nl2]of water?[np]
[nl3]You asked the boy at
[scl]the lake to dig wells?
[scl]Enough lies![np]
[scl]Tell me where you hid
[scl]the 「town's treasure!「
[scl]
[en2]
Indio asked me for a
[nl2]favor...[np]
[nl3]Do you guys know where
[scl]he is right now?
[en2]
Indio said this lake
[nl2]will dry up soon,[np]
[nl3]so he asked me to dig
[scl]some wells...[np]
[scl]To dig a well, I'll
[scl]need the help of these
[scl]penguins here.[np]
[scl]They have a mysterious
[scl]power that enables
[scl]them to sense water.[np]
[scl]But these penguins are
[scl]in the middle of
[scl]mating season![np]
[scl]I can't get any of
[scl]them to leave the
[scl]lake.[np]
[scl]  Help me catch one?[X$6A] 
[scl]    Okay, sure!
[scl]    Do it yourself![X$68]
[en1]
That's the spirit![np]
[nl2]I'll head back and
[nl3]wait for you guys to
[scl]bring me a penguin.
[en1]
That's because...
[nl2]I can't swim!
[en2]
You don't have
[nl2]anything to dig with?[np]
[nl3]Okay, I'll give you my
[scl]invention, a 「hole
[scl]digging machine!「[np]
[scl]...Is what I'd like to
[scl]say, but I only have
[scl]the concept drawn up.[np]
[scl]I'll give it to the
[scl]kid who likes building
[scl]stuff the most.
[en2]
I'd like to give you
[nl2]the 「hole digging
[nl3]machine「 I designed,[np]
[scl]but I only have the
[scl]plan for it.[np]
[scl]You'll have to find
[scl]the parts on your own.
[scl][en1]
[F2]Received hole Digging
[nl2]Machine Blueprints![np]
[nl3]I think I've seen
[scl]these parts before...
[en1]
My gut tells me there
[nl2]are [C$24] spots in town
[nl3]just right for a well.
[en1]
If we don't dig them
[nl2]fast, it'll be a
[nl3]disaster!
[en2]
[F2]You made a Hole
[nl2]Digging Machine!
[en1]
But it's too heavy to
[nl2]lift.
[nl3]Max, you take it!
[en2]
Let's make Max carry
[nl2]it!
[en2]

[nl2]Get it together, Jack.
[en2]
[SP$012C]Moo~ moo~.

[nl2]TL: I'm really
[nl3]ticklish, so don't
[scl]come any closer!

[nl3]a lady?!
[en1]
[F2]You did it![np]
[nl2]Now the town will
[nl3]always have plenty of
[scl]water![np]
[scl]Thank you! I'll keep
[scl]this penguin.[np]
[scl]Oh, you guys, I have
[scl]something interesting
[scl]to tell you.[np]
[scl]If you want to save
[scl]Indio, get a frog.[np]
[scl]The sheriff hates
[scl]frogs more than
[scl]anything!

Thanks to you kids,
[nl2]the town's water

Let's look for the

[nl3]I think it was below
[scl]the room I was trapped
[scl]in.
[en2]
Yikes! A frog!!
[nl2]Help me!!
[en1]
The guy on the left is
[nl2]Benson! And I'm next

[scl]You kids are time
[scl]travelers?![np]
[scl]Please, take this
[scl]photograph and look
[scl]for Benson!
[en2]
Eh? You say you know
[nl2]Benson?[np]
[nl3]It's not that I don't
[scl]believe you, but do
[scl]you have any proof?

You guys must be time

[nl2]is good?
[nl3]Point to it.
[en2]
[SP$020C]I see, the one with
[nl2]just a window...[np]
[nl3]Yeah, simple is good![en1]
[SP$020C]I see, the one with a
[nl2]door AND a window...[np]
[nl3]Yeah, without a door,
[scl]you can't get inside,
[scl]can you??
[en1]
[SP$020C]I see, the one with a
[nl2]door on top...[np]
[nl3]Yeah, then if it
[scl]snows, I can still get
[scl]out!
[en1]
[SP$020C]Oh, the one with lots
[nl2]of windows...[np]
[nl3]Good idea, then it
[scl]will be really bright
[scl]inside!

Thanks![np]
[nl2]When I finish it, I'd
[nl3]like to show it to

[scl]But there's still a
[scl]long ways to go...[np]
[scl]Come back when you're
[scl]adults!
[en1]
[C$32] isn't any good?
[nl2]Okay, then pick your
[nl3]favorite.

Yippee!
[nl2]The door opened!
[en2]
Actually... M...my
[nl2]hip went out and I
[nl3]can't move...
[en2]
...But.
[en1]
It seems like fun, so
[nl2]I'll do it!
[en1]
[F2]You got some Dynamite![np]
[nl2]Equip it and use it
[nl3]with the [C$04] button!
[en1]
Max, try to think
[nl2]before using an item.
[en2]
Can you come a little
[nl2]closer?
[en2]
Stop dawdling and use
[nl2]the dynamite to find
[nl3]an entrance!
[en2]
Want to try it with
[nl2]-BOOM- one shot?
[en2]
Who is holding the
[nl2]dynamite?
[en2]
Alright, I've taken
[nl2]the dynamite back.[np]
[nl3]When I use this, it
[scl]will send up a lot of
[scl]smoke.[np]
[scl]So don't get lost!
[en1]
As long as our masks
[nl2]are on, you'll never
[nl3]get past us!
[en2]
It's too hard to push
[nl2]by hand...
[en2]
It's pretty heavy...
[en2]
To use teamwork, we
[nl2]have to position
[nl3]ourselves better.
[en2]
If we pull it like
[nl2]this, we'll be
[nl3]squished!
[en2]
Want to get down?
[en2]
Without a bridge, we
[nl2]can't cross.
[en2]
Captain, what's the
[nl2]hurry?
[nl3][np]
[scl]But even in a hurry,
[scl]your face looks great.
[scl][en2]
I wonder if something
[nl2]would happen if I
[nl3]smacked it.
[en2]
Rakko, rakko.[np]
[nl2]TL: I scare easily, so
[nl3]don't startle me!
[en2]
Rakko, rakko.[np]
[nl2]TL: I scare easily, so
[nl3]don't startle me!
[en2]
If you don't hurry,
[nl2]the Mammoth Brothers
[nl3]will catch you!
[en2]
You're pretty bold to
[nl2]try to steal anything
[nl3]from us![np]
[scl]Hey you!
[scl]The punk with the
[scl]hat...![np]
[scl]You'll be the first to
[scl]taste our Dance of 
[scl]Death!!
[en1]
So you're the leader?!
[en2]
Don't think you can
[nl2]escape from us!
[en2]
........[en2]
Listen to what they're
[nl2]saying!
[en2]
If you don't push it
[nl2]quickly, the Mammoth
[nl3]guys will wake up.
[en2]
If you return to the
[nl2]other world, give me a
[nl3]visit, okay?
[en2]
If you return to the
[nl2]other world, give me a
[nl3]visit, okay?
[en2]
Thank goodness he was
[nl2]found innocent!
[en2]
It's a message Benson
[nl2]left for us. What does
[nl3]it mean?
[en2]
Is something there?
[en2]
Come here and look at
[nl2]the blueprint!
[en2]
What is this
[nl2]picture...?
[en2]
Oh, it's Benson!
[en2]
Indio came to see
[nl2]Benson. He said the
[nl3]town was in trouble.
[en2]
What's the Crystal Ball
[nl2]called that leads to
[nl3]Maverick's Treasure?[np]
[scl]It's called the Blue
[scl]Blue Crystal, right?
[en2]
Hmm... What is this
[nl2]picture?
[en2]
Well, if it isn't
[nl2]Benson!
[en2]
It's a picture of when
[nl2]Indio met with Benson!
[en2]
The 「Town's Treasure「
[nl2]was in Benson's hou...
[nl3]Hou... Achoo!!! House.[np]
[scl]I'm sure of it.
[en2]
What's with this
[nl2]picture?
[en2]
It's Benson!
[nl2]He was a strong, fine
[nl3]man.
[en2]
It's Indio![np]
[nl2]He lives on the other
[scl]side of penguin lake
[scl]with his daughter.
[en2]
It's the 「Town's
[nl2]Treasure.「[np]
[nl3]But Indio said it was
[scl]part of a time
[scl]machine.
[en2]
Where'd you get this
[nl2]picture?!
[en2]
It's my husband. When
[nl2]did he take this
[nl3]photograph...?
[en2]
It's the man who came
[nl2]to see my husband.[np]
[nl3]He said he knew how to
[scl]travel through time...[np]
[scl]I wonder if it was
[scl]true.
[en2]
It's the Crystal Ball
[nl2]my husband found.
[en2]
What is this picture?!
[en2]
It's my dad!
[en2]
I dunno!
[en2]
I haven't the
[nl2]slightest idea!
[en2]
What is this photo?
[en2]
It's the old man who
[nl2]lent us this house!
[en2]
It's my father! He's
[nl2]not in right now.
[en2]
Only God can obtain
it now!
[en2]
Pii, pii.[np]
[nl2]TL: Mama! Mama!
[en2]
Flutey, flute, flute.[np]
[nl2]TL: God of time, take
[nl3]that man to the[np]
[scl]future~.
[en2]
I wonder if it has
[nl2]something to do with
[nl3]that time warp...?
[en2]
Without a ship, these
[nl2]people don't really
[nl3]seem like pirates...
[en2]
I'm high on life!!
[en1]
...I don't really
[nl2]understand.
[nl3][np]
[scl]But we have to keep
[scl]our cool.... And get
[scl]out of here fast!
[en2]
The Patchies were
[nl2]triplets...!
[en2]
「How to Pirate「
[nl2]It looks like a good
[nl3]read.
[en2]
I want it a little
[nl2]bit!
[en2]
We want to sleep in a
[nl2]bed, too~.
[en2]
Can you imagine trying
to move one of these
around?!
[en2]
This isn't pirate
[nl2]gear, right...?
[en2]
I wonder if it's still
[nl2]in use.
[en2]
This chair looks
[nl2]pretty hard.
[en2]
This is maybe a pirate
[nl2]rug...?[np]
[nl3]Nah... That'd just be
[scl]dumb.
[scl]
[en2]
[X$6A][SP$00D3]
[nl2]   Wait, Miss Gina!
[nl3][np]
[scl]    I'll stay! Deon
[scl]    I'll stay! Max
[scl]    I'll stay! Jack[X$6E]
[en1]
What is this picture?!
[en2]
Hey, our boss!
[en2]
I don't know!
[en2]
A treasure!
[en2]
What is this picture?
[en2]
Oh! Our boss!
[en2]
I don't know, but he's
[nl2]a looker alright.
[en2]
A treasure!
[en2]
Goo goo ga...[en2]
Waah! waah!
[nl2]...He's having a
[nl3]nightmare.
[en2]
Goo goo.
[en2]
Yay! Hooray![np]
[nl2]...They saw the 
[nl2]treasure and started
[nl3]cheering.
[en2]
Croak. Ribbit.[np]
[nl2]TL: Just pathetic.
[en2]
That's just like Miss
[nl2]Sisko![np]
[nl3]Her father was a fine
[scl]man, and the same
[scl]blood is in her.
[en2]
How peaceful~!
[en2]
Thanks to those two, I
[nl2]became Mayor.
[en2]
My husband once told
[nl2]me about some heroic
[nl3]kids that he knew.[np]
[scl]Now that I've got a
[scl]story to match, I'm
[scl]sure he'll be happy.
[en2]
Our town became
[nl2]prosperous thanks to
[nl3]Benson and Indio!
[en2]
Indio's daughter is a
[nl2]schoolteacher.
[nl3][np]
[scl]She's very respectable
[scl]just like her father.
[scl][np]
[scl]Benson's son is....
[scl]Well... Nobody knows
[scl]where he went to.
[en2]
Miss Sisko reminds
[nl2]you of Miss Gina.
[en2]
Studying is all well
[nl2]and good.
[nl3][np]
[scl]But sometimes you need
[scl]play outside!
[en2]
It's so nice to study
[nl2]under the great blue
[nl3]sky.
[en2]
Miss Sisko's class
[nl2]should start soon, but
[nl3]she's running late...
[en2]
If you don't like
[nl2]studying, you should
[nl3]try Miss S's classes![np]
[scl]They're really easy to
[scl]understand.
[en2]
Hey, isn't Miss Sisko
[nl2]just wonderful?
[en2]
Miss Sisko is a great
[nl2]teacher, isn't she?
[en2]
When you get home, say
[nl2]hi to your teacher for
[nl3]me.
[en2]
Isn't it a great
[nl2]house?
[en2]
This is where life
[nl2]begins!
[en2]

[nl2]  Hey![C$56] Wait for me!
[en2]
Meow~, meow~.
[en2]
I feel like everything
[nl2]is different than it
[nl3]used to be...
[en2]
Did you remember our
[nl2]promise?
[en2]
What's with this
[nl2]picture...
[en2]
I dunno...
[en2]
Couldn't tell ya...
[en2]
Never seen it before
[nl2]in my life...
[en2]
It doesn't look like
[nl2]it gets used much.
[en2]
It doesn't seem like
[nl2]we can lift it...
[en2]
I want it~...
[en2]
What could it be used
[nl2]for...?
[en2]
You shouldn't decorate
[nl2]your house with
[nl3]something like this.[np]
[scl]It'll just add to the
[scl]clutter!
[en2]
Decorating your house
[nl2]with something like
[nl3]this'll just look bad.
[en2]
The treasure chest
[nl2]won't open like that!
[en2]
It's made of gold?
[nl2]That's kinda weird!
[en2]
Ah, hah!
[en2]
Whose grave is
[nl2]this...?
[en2]
I wonder what this
[nl2]black stone is for?
[en2]
Pegi, pegi, pegi~.[np]
[nl2]TL: It's not so bad
[nl3]being a human's pet~.
[en2]
[X$6A]Oh, right! The

[nl3]the leader anymore.[np]
[scl]...Please save Miss
[scl]Gina!

[Deon], If you're the
[nl2]leader, then do
[nl3]something about it!
[en2]
Thanks for your hard
[nl2]work!
[en2]
There's lots of
[nl2]firewood near the
[nl3]lake.
[en2]
...Got it. I'll go
[nl2]call for help.
[nl3][np]
[scl]You just sit tight and
[scl]wait for help to
[scl]arrive.
[en1]
What, a time bomb!?
[nl2]That's intense.[np]
[nl3]Hurry up and get out
[scl]of here!
[en1]
Oh hii~, it's been far
[nl2]too long.
[nl3][np]
[scl]Stuff is really
[scl]getting crazy.
[scl]Earlier...
[en1]
Golly, do you talk a
[nl2]lot. Now's not the
[nl3]time for that.[np]
[scl]Time is of the
[scl]essence. Okay?
[scl][np]
[scl]It might be scary, but
[scl]wind will come from
[scl]below...[np]
[scl]So it should be fine.
[scl]
[scl]Okay, let's go.
[en1]
Who would have thought
[nl2]there was a balloon
[nl3]hidden here?
[en2]
We have to think fast.
[nl2]With our weights...[np]
[nl3]Someone heavy should
[scl]go on the left...[np]
[scl]The two others will
[scl]pump from the right
[scl]side.
[en1]
[SP$00D3]This is my greatest
[nl2]invention.
[nl3][np]
[scl]People thought it was
[scl]impossible for humans
[scl]to fly, [np]
[scl]but this hot air
[scl]balloon allows humans
[scl]to do just that.[np]
[scl]This is the treasure I
[scl]leave to anyone who is
[scl]able to find it.[np]
[scl]It's also the only way
[scl]to escape from the
[scl]dungeon.[np]
[scl]I pray this device
[scl]still works when you
[scl]find it.[np]
[scl]

Hurray! The balloon is

I'll let you have my

[nl3]「Soccer Shoes!「[np]
[scl]So how are you going
[scl]to play soccer?[np]
[scl]Come back when you
[scl]wise up.
[en2]
If you don't go
[nl2]underwater, you can't
[nl3]reach the shoes...[np]
[scl]But it looks like the
[scl]water will hurt your
[scl]eyes~.
[en2]
  I need your help![X$6A]
[nl2]    Okay.
[nl3]    Nope.[X$68]

Oof, that's harsh.

Seems like we could

Sakes alive am I

Let's try it like

Hm, something seems

Yes, you put items in

You want to save Miss

What should you do
[nl2]from here?[np]
[nl3]...All you can do is

[scl]You have to open the

[scl]Did you already meet a

[scl]If not, then look
[scl]along the coast in the

What are you doing?
[nl2]What? I won't do

Hey, guess what, you
[nl2]guys?[np]
[nl3]You have [C$1E] Luck
[scl]Rocks. Didn't notice?[np]
[scl]I'll take pity on you
[scl]and give you [num] Luck
[scl]Rock for the road.[np]
[scl]You should really quit
[scl]while you're ahead.
[en1]
[SP$0339]You received [num] Luck
[nl2]Rock from Jim.[np]
[nl3]He might not be so bad
[scl]after all...
[en2]
These are the Luck
[nl2]Rocks we painstakingly
[nl3]collected.[np]
[scl]Don't think you'll
[scl]take them all for
[scl]nothing.[np]
[scl]Give it a try if
[scl]you're feeling lucky.
[en2]
...Dang it, Jim![np]
[nl2]Those are the Luck
[nl3]Rocks we worked so
[scl]hard to get...
[en2]
Is it okay to do this?[np]
[nl2]If Miss Gina finds
[nl3]out,[np]
[scl]I'll get slapped up
[scl]and down by my mommy
[scl]again...
[en2]
That's why I said you
[nl2]should stop...[np]
[nl3]I guess we'll just
[scl]have to go look for
[scl]more Luck Rocks.
[en2]
Shall we try getting
[nl2]closer?
[en2]
After checking the
blackboard with [C$46],
you can use an item.[np]
[nl3]Use [C$46] to check the
[scl]crates again please.
[en2]
Chirp, chirpy![np]
[nl2]TL:...It's true!
[nl3]I don't know!
[scl]Believe me~!!
[en2]
Let's try a dash with
[nl2]the [C$04] button.
[en2]
How can we get it, I
[nl2]wonder?
[en2]
Then show it to me.
[nl2]Hurry up and prepare
[nl3]for departure!
[en2]
Why is there a hole
[nl2]here?
[en2]
Let's give it a smack.
[en2]
That's no good!
[nl2]Your timing is off.
[nl3]Let's try again.[np]
[scl]On the count of [C$24],
[scl]push the [C$02] button!
[en1]
Come on!
[nl2]Push the [C$02] button!
[nl3]Do it![en1]
What's this picture?
[en2]
This man was with
[nl2]Indio.
[en2]
This isn't a bad
[nl2]person!
[en2]
Indio had it...
[en2]
Forgot? I'll tell you.
[nl2]Hurry and come here.
[en2]
Come play again.
[nl2]It seems Jim is
[nl3]cooking up a new game.
[en2]
Keep this a secret...
[nl2]But Jim... Has a crush
[nl3]on Miss Gina.
[en2]
[X$79]Mash it to move it!
[nl2]   [C$42]       [C$12][X$7E]
[en1]
[X$79] Push it to move it!
[nl2]        [C$42][X$7E]
[en1]
[X$79]      Mash it!
[nl2]        [C$12][X$7E]
[en1]
What's wrong?
[nl2]Don't quit now!
[en1]
You know, green is my
[nl2]favorite color.[np]
[nl3]Luck Rock yellow is my
[scl]favorite, too.
[en2]
Hehe, that tickles.
[en2]
This red scarf is my
[nl2]trademark.
[nl3]Remember that, okay?
[en2]
There's nothing in my
[nl2]pocket.
[en2]
There's really nothing
[nl2]in there, okay?
[en2]
Why do you keep poking
[nl2]me there?!?!
[en2]

[nl2] Stop it this instant!
[en2]
There are important
[nl2]instructions on that
[nl3]paper.[np]
[scl]Get closer and give it
[scl]a good look.[np]
[scl]When you want to leave
[scl]this screen,[np]
[scl]press [C$04] or select [C$44]
[scl]and press [C$02].[np]
[scl]Then the camping can
[scl]really begin!
[en1]
Haha, look! It came
[nl2]the other day.
[en1]
Ooo! Ooo![np]
[nl2]TL: I'm glad you
[nl3]came, Winky.[np]
[scl]Today is your 16th
[scl]birthday.[np]
[scl]I can hardly believe
[scl]how much you've
[scl]grown...[np]
[scl]Time passes by so
[scl]quickly.
[scl]
[en1]

[nl2]  Listen up, Winky!
[en1]
If you don't 「ken「
[nl2]something shown here,
[nl3]point [C$0C] at it.
[en2]
Please clean off the
[nl2]top [C$22] windows![np]
[nl3]I can't reach them,
[scl]but I'm sure you kids
[scl]can think of a way.
[en2]
There's a dangerous
[nl2]hole in the floor![np]
[nl3]I need you to cover it
[scl]with a board and
[scl]hammer it into place.
[en2]
I want you to move
[nl2]this table for me![np]
[nl3]Please move it from
[scl]the right side of the
[scl]room to the left side.[np]
[scl]Be careful you don't
[scl]squish yourselves!
[en2]
Thanks to you kids, it
[nl2]turned out alright![np]
[nl3]I hate to ask so much,
[scl]but please take care
[scl]of the rest as well...
[en2]
Bring some other kids
[nl2]over!
[en2]
Once you get to this
[nl2]age, it's hard to
[nl3]shout.[np]
[scl]Come a litle closer.
[en2]
Nice work!
[en2]
There's nothing but
[nl2]clocks inside there.[np]
[nl3]If you'd like, you can
[scl]take the key from
[scl]under the model boat.
[en2]
[SP$00D3]Is the mansion key
[nl2]under here?
[en2]
It's nice to change
[nl2]things up in the room
[nl3]occasionally.
[en2]
It looks heavy.
[en2]
The floor still has
[nl2]that hole in it~![np]
[nl3]It's impossible to
[scl]move it until the
[scl]hole's been fixed.
[en2]
I hope granny doesn't
[nl2]fall in the hole and
[nl3]hurt herself...
[en2]
This would be perfect
[nl2]for covering a hole.
[en2]
We lifted it![np]
[nl2]Move with [C$08] and press
[nl3][C$02] to drop it.
[en1]
You can't tell without
[nl2]getting closer~!
[en2]
It seems too far to
[nl2]reach!
[en2]
It's caked with dust!
[nl2]Gross!
[en2]
The sun is so bright!
[en2]
[X$79]Let's clean the window!
[nl2]   [C$42]       [C$12][X$7E]
[en1]
Go home! Leave!
[en2]
[X$79]Pull his cheeks!
[nl2]        [C$42][X$7E]
[en1]
[X$79]Push his nose!
[nl2]        [C$12][X$7E]
[en1]
[X$79] Let's get naughty!
[nl2]        [C$42][X$7E]
[en1]
...A zipper?
[en1]
No, it can't be!!
[nl2]Nooo!
[en1]
I'll let you live to
[nl2]see another day.
[nl3]Remember this!
[en1]
Maybe I'll sing a song
[nl2]until the food is
[nl3]ready.[np]
[scl]I'll sing my true
[scl]feelings.
[en1]
Ouch!
[nl2]What was that for?!
[en1]
Blub, glub... Blub...[np]
[nl2]TL: Even if there's
[nl3]bait in front of me,
[scl]I won't eat it~.[np]
[scl]My tummy's full.
[en2]
...Blubble, glubble...[np]
[nl2]TL: This is a tiny
[nl3]pond...[np]
[scl]So even if I swim
[scl]fast, there's nowhere
[scl]to go... Right?
[en2]
...He looks like he
[nl2]wants to start a
[nl3]fight.
[en2]
Blub, mub! Blub![np]
[nl2]TL: You aren't
[nl3]thinking of catching
[scl]me, are you?[np]
[scl]Hah, I'd like to see
[scl]you try it.[np]
[scl]After I grab a hold of
[scl]your bait, you'd best
[scl]be warned.[np]
[scl]If you try to pull too
[scl]fast, I'll get away!
[en2]
Blubble, glub, glub?[np]
[nl2]TL: Listen, I've made
[nl3]hundreds of fisherman
[scl]cry--[np]
[scl]All due to my extreme
[scl]flipper strength.[np]
[scl]After I take the bait,
[scl]if you just hold [C$08]
[scl]without letting go,[np]
[scl]you won't stand a[np]
[scl]chance.
[scl]Got it?
[en2]
[X$6A]If you want to learn
[nl2]about a button, move
[nl3][C$0C] to it and press [C$02].
[en2]
You can use the [C$02]
[nl2]button for searching
[nl3]or talking to people.
[en1]
The [C$04] button allows
[nl2]use of the item you've
[nl3]equipped in the menu.
[en1]
The [C$06] button opens
[nl2]the menu, just like
[nl3]the 「START「 button.[np]
[scl]You can change
[scl]your equipped items
[scl]from the menu.
[en1]
The [C$00] button blows
[nl2]your whistle.[np]
[nl3]It brings your team
[scl]together if they are
[scl]in the area.
[en1]
The [C$14] button shows
[nl2]everyone's HP[np]
[nl3]and their currently
[scl]equipped items.
[en1]
The [C$0A] button changes
[nl2]the leader.
[en1]
The 「START「 button
[nl2]opens the menu, just
[nl3]like the [C$06] button.[np]
[scl]You can change your
[scl]equipped items from
[scl]the menu.
[en1]
The 「SELECT「 button is
[nl2]for saving in your

[scl]Be sure to save often.
[en1]
The [C$08] is used for
[nl2]moving or selecting
[nl3]command panels.
[en1]
Let's get closer!
[en2]
What could it mean...?
[en2]
I wonder if these
[nl2]numbers mean
[nl3]something important?
[en2]
Maybe it makes sense
[nl2]upside down?
[en2]
The answer is
[nl2]simple...
[en2]
[X$79]Move it! [C$04] to cancel.
[nl2]        [C$42][X$7E]
[en1]
Su...Sucker?!
[en2]
Enter the numbers with
[nl2][C$02] and press OK when
[nl3]you're done!
[en2]
Huh!?
[nl2]Something seems off...
[en2]
There must be a switch
[nl2]somewhere!
[en2]
Pii! pii![np]
[nl2]TL: Stay out of our
[nl3]way or you'll get
[scl]hurt!
[en2]
[X$79]Move it. [C$04] to cancel.
[nl2]        [C$42][X$7E]
[en1]
You found my weak
[nl2]spot![np]
[nl3]Forgive me! I'll never
[scl]prank anyone again!
[en1]
Squeak squeak![np]
[nl2]TL: It's my glorious
[nl3]tail![np]
[scl]I don't care if you
[scl]touch it!
[en2]
Squeak~![np]
[nl2]TL: That tickles!
[nl3]Stop it!
[en2]
There's no way I can
[nl2]lift this... Maybe if
[nl3]we work together?
[en2]
I really want it, but
[nl2]I can't reach it...[np]
[nl3]Maybe there's some way
[scl]to knock it down?
[en2]
Stop it! Please stop!
[nl2]Anywhere but my
[nl3]ears...
[en2]
Well, that's just too
[nl2]much to look past, now
[nl3]isn't it...
[en2]
Now's our chance...
[nl2]Let's run while we
[nl3]still can.
[en2]
Full of nutrition! It
[nl2]might be good for
[nl3]restoring health.[np]
[scl]But you can't eat it
[scl]unless you are
[scl]injured.
[en2]
This is... probably
[nl2]where we are right
[nl3]now!
[en2]
I want to get it, but
[nl2]it's too far away.
[en2]
They have something to
[nl2]do with the guys who
[nl3]took Miss Gina, right?[np]
[scl]
[scl]Let's chase them down
[scl]and find out!
[en2]
Found a Key!
[en1]
「Pirate Ship Lysander「
[nl2]is written on it.[np]
[nl3]The name makes it
[scl]sound a lot cooler
[scl]than it looks.
[en2]
「My son Blue and
[nl2]Blue's mother「
[nl3]...Is written here.
[en2]
There's a painting of
[nl2]a pirate.
[en2]
Fight or flee?...
[nl2]
[nl3]......RUNNNN!!
[en2]
You dummies aren't
[nl2]planning on going
[nl3]after Miss Gina,[np]
[scl]are you?
[scl]You've never even
[scl]been in a fight.[np]
[scl]You probably don't know
[scl]know you can use [C$14] to
[scl]display your health,[np]
[scl]do you?[np]
[scl]If your health drops
[scl]to zero, it's game
[scl]over, man![np]
[scl]Just wait for the
[scl]police to get here.[np]
[scl]Life isn't like a
[scl]video game, you know.
[scl]Later.

[nl2]          2[SP$023B]
[en1]

[nl2]          [C$24][SP$032D]
[en1]

[nl2][F2] Alright, it's open!
[en1]
I feel like I've seen
[nl2]this 「Do not enter「
[nl3]sign before...
[en2]
It seems like the tent
[nl2]we're in right now...
[en2]
Miss Gina must be in
[nl2]the cave to the North!
[en2]
There's a big lake by
[nl2]the cave? Let's use
[nl3]that as a landmark.
[en2]
This picture is awful!
[nl2]Miss Gina is much
[nl3]prettier!
[en2]
What if we put one
[nl2]of us on the left and
[nl3]right, [np]
[scl]and the last guy
[scl]either on top or
[scl]bottom?
[en2]
The pirates took the
[nl2]「rope「 and ran off.[np]
[nl3]I don't know where
[scl]they went,[np]
[scl]but they must have
[scl]left footprints in
[scl]the sand!
[en1]
Did you already open
[nl2]the treasure chest in
[nl3]the forest?[np]
[scl]Wasn't there a red
[scl]treasure chest?[np]
[scl]There might be
[scl]something good in it!
[en1]
There's a barking dog
[nl2]under this tree.[np]
[nl3]He looks mean, so
[scl]let's smack him with a
[scl]ball...[np]
[scl]That might teach him
[scl]some manners!
[en1]
Lack of bridge
[nl2]stressing you out?[np]
[nl3]The leaf near the
[scl]river was a bit
[scl]parched, last I saw...[np]
[scl]It's said to become
[scl]quite enormous when
[scl]watered!
[en1]
Did you open the red
[nl2]chest where Winky
[nl3]saved you guys?[np]
[scl]...How unfortunate.
[en1]
Are you using the
[nl2]「Hammer「?[np]
[nl3]Try hammering the peg[np]
[scl]in front of the pipe![np]
[scl]You can move the pipe
[scl]with [C$48].[np]
[scl]Good luck~!
[en1]

[nl2]  Sweet, it opened!
[en1]
[X$6A][SP$0339]You found a Luck Rock!
[nl2]You have [X$6C] now!
[en1]
It says 「Danger ahead!
[nl2]You WILL be injured!「
[nl3]...What should we do?
[en2]
Oh, that's the
[nl2]Colonel's official
[nl3]permission slip![np]
[scl]How did you get it?
[scl]...It's real, right?[np]
[scl]Well, alright, go on
[scl]ahead.
[en1]
Can I be a little more
[nl2]surprised?
[en2]
She was a tomboy with
[nl2]a bad mouth...[np]
[nl3]But I feel a little
[scl]lonely now that she's
[scl]gone.
[en1]
Blub, glub![np]
[nl2]TL: Don't worry about
[nl3]me, I can get back to
[scl]the lake on my own.
[en2]
Hurry and show the
[nl2]「Fishing Hook「 to our
[nl3]leader!
[en2]
I see...
[nl2]Just as I thought![np]
[nl3]Oh, sorry, I actually
[scl]don't have a clue.
[en2]
Hurry up and choose
[nl2]「Fishing Hook「 from
[nl3]the [C$4A] panel.[np]
[scl]Use it with the [C$02]
[scl]button.
[en2]
We need to call the
[nl2]police on the
[nl3]mainland.[np]
[scl]Camp is over now, man.[np]
[scl]Let's go back to the
[scl]mainland together,
[scl]alright?
[en2]
I misjudged you guys![np]
[nl2]But who's the idiot
[nl3]who stole their
[scl]treasure?
[en2]
I wonder what's for
[nl2]lunch...?
[nl3][np]
[scl]...Isn't what I should
[scl]be thinking about
[scl]right now!
[en2]
A small Red Key might
[nl2]fit this keyhole!
[en2]
A small lanky Blue Key
[nl2]might fit this
[nl3]keyhole.
[en2]
A great big Green Key
[nl2]might fit this
[nl3]keyhole!
[en2]
Any color key should
[nl2]fit this keyhole!
[en2]
[F2]Dorothy received the
[nl2]Firewood![np]
[nl3]Err... What?
[en1]
Hey you!
[nl2]Well, if it isn't
[nl3][team] Team![np]
[scl]So you're not dead
[scl]yet!
[en1]
Upon inspecting
[nl2]closer, you see 3
[nl3]of them...
[en2]

[nl2] Why won't this open?
[en2]
Something's wrong.
[nl2]Get on 3 sides of the
[nl3]boulder and hit [C$48]![np]
[scl]It's the only way.
[en1]
Something's not right.
[nl2]Put one on top, two on
[nl3]bottom, and hit [C$48]![np]
[scl]It's the only way.
[en1]
To use teamwork, we've
[nl2]gotta position
[nl3]ourselves better!
[en1]
If you want a tip,
[nl2]choose Luck Rock from
[nl3]the [C$4A] menu!
[en2]
Hurry back to the
[nl2]ship![np]
[nl3]But if you want more
[scl]Luck Rocks, try a
[scl]house in town.[np]
[scl]Good luck~!
[en1]
Did you find a tent?[np]
[nl2]You should listen to
[nl3]what the adult inside
[scl]says!
[en1]
To continue in the
[nl2]underground cave:[np]
[nl3]You'll need one person
[scl]to operate the
[scl]machine.[np]
[scl]The others can go on
[scl]ahead.[np]
[scl]The switch is next to
[scl]the shutter, so don't
[scl]miss it~!
[en1]
The bully monkey's
[nl2]boss is a gorilla.[np]
[nl3]I bet he'd be happy if
[scl]you recorded a girl
[scl]gorilla's voice...[np]
[scl]And played it back for
[scl]him!
[en1]
Thank you come again~!
[nl2]Received [X$6B] Luck
[nl3]Rocks!
[en1]

[nl2] Who are you!?
[en2]
It's dangerous, so you
[nl2]really shouldn't go!
[en2]
Our camping island is
[nl2]this way!
[nl3]Wait for us...![np]
[scl]...Miss Gina!!
[en2]
...By the way, who has
[nl2]the tape recorder? [np]
[nl3]I hate to ask, but
[scl]could you give it back
[scl]to me?
[en2]
If you wanna know
[nl2]about the town, why
[nl3]not ask the sheriff?
[en1]
The monster flowers in
[nl3]「Death Lake「 can be
[scl]defeated in two steps.
[scl]First, you kick them
[scl]in their wiggling
[scl]roots...[np]
[scl]Then hit them in the
[scl]flower when it opens
[scl]up~!
[en1]
Did you listen to the
[nl2]request of Indio's
[nl3]daughter to the east?[np]
[scl]Didn't your teacher
[scl]tell you to help out
[scl]those in need~!?
[en1]
There must be a water
[nl2]supply store in town.[np]
[nl3]If you show him that
[scl]picture, I bet he'll
[scl]be surprised!
[en1]
The old lady next door
[nl2]is in quite a fix. Why
[nl3]don't you lend a hand?
[en1]
It seems like the
[nl2]captured Indio had
[nl3]something to say![np]
[scl]...Why not give him a
[scl]listen?
[en1]
I saw the man Indio
[nl2]mentioned east of the

Did you try digging 3
[nl2]holes? One hole is
[nl3]blocked by a cow...[np]
[scl]But if you tickle his
[scl]nose, he'll move for
[scl]you.
[en1]
To chase off the
[nl2]Sheriff, you need
[nl3]a Frog![np]
[scl]You can catch a Frog
[scl]with the Fishing Rod.[np]
[scl]But you can't just
[scl]throw it out there![np]
[scl]You have to cast it on
[scl]a leaf, and then watch
[scl]the Frog's reaction.[np]
[scl]Sorry if you already
[scl]knew~!
[en1]
Benson is hiding in an
[nl2]empty house.[np]
[nl3]But you can't get in

[nl2] That's the only way!
[en2]

[en2]
Let's get close and
[nl2]check it out.
[en2]
You can't put in any
[nl2]more Luck Rocks while
[nl3]you are playing!

You kids are tough
[nl2]customers, not giving

[en1]
Trade for [X$6B] Rocks?[X$6A]
[nl2]    Okay
[nl3]    Can you go lower?[X$68]

But what will you do

[en2]
By the way...

M.F.Smith
Field Journal-
[nl2]March 22:[np]
[nl2]I found a mysterious
[nl3]Ball. It seems to be
[scl]some sort of Crystal.[np]
[scl]We brought it with us
[scl]into the depths of the
[scl]island,[np]
[scl]where it was brought
[scl]into contact with an
[scl]enormous Baobab tree.
[scl]The ancient Baobab has
[scl]long been providing
[scl]vital nutrients to[np]
[scl]plant and animal life
[scl]in the surrounding
[scl]area.[np]
[scl]Since contact with the
[scl]Crystal Ball,[np]
[scl]the Baobab seems to be
[scl]producing an excess
[scl]of oil.
[scl]I hope the Crystal
[scl]Ball isn't continuously
[scl]abused in this way...[np]
[scl][SP$0121]Lately, strange things
[scl]have been happening on
[scl]this island.[np]
[scl]My dog, Socks, has
[scl]been acting strangely
[scl]ever since he wandered[np]
[scl]into the jungle...
[scl]I'm quite concerned.
[en2]
Did you go further
[nl2]into the island?[np]
[nl3]It seems they harvest
[scl]an oil from the Baobab
[scl]tree a bit farther in.
[en2]
He was studying the
[nl3]parasite's reaction
[scl]to a certain liquid.[np]
[scl]The strange thing is,
[scl]that liquid is common
[scl]salt water![np]
[scl]No idea why it reacts
[scl]to salt water, but I
[scl]made this for you.
[en1]
[F2]Received Prof.
[nl2]Marlowe's Saltwater
[nl3]Spray![np]
[scl]Yikes, salty!
[en1]
I guess I'll give this
[nl2]to...[np]
[nl3]A clever-seeming lanky
[scl]boy like me...[np]
[scl]Jack!
[en2]
I'll let that lanky
[nl2]fellow, Jack, have it.
[nl3]So come get it.
[en2]
You might be able to
[nl2]crack the riddle.[np]
[nl3]I'll give this to you.
[scl]Use it wisely!
[en1]
What kind of water is
[nl2]it?
[en2]
Salt water... Is it
[nl2]from the ocean?
[en2]
Oh, that made a great
[nl2]photo!
[nl3]Good work, boys.
[en1]
The Luck Rocks are
[nl2]gone!!
[en1]

[nl2]    Hey, open up~!
[en2]
If they raise the
[nl2]lever, the door
[nl3]shuts...
[en2]
Hey~,when this boat's
[nl2]a-rockin' don't come
[nl3]a-knockin'!
[en2]
[F2]You put Salt Water in
[nl2]the Water Bottle!
[en1]

[nl2]  Eh? What's this...?
[nl3][np]
[scl]A key!!...
[scl]How do we get it...?
[scl][np]
[scl]Hmm...
[scl]Should we use an item?
[en2]
[SP$00D3]Okay, now we can pull
[nl2]the key out through
[nl3]his mouth...[np]
[scl]Maybe...?
[en1]
[X$79]  Aim and pull!
[nl2]   [C$42]       [C$12][X$7E]
[en1]
[F2]You got the... ンburpン
[nl2]Cave Key.[np]
[nl3]It's a little acidic.
[en1]
Is this the key to the
[nl2]cave?
[en2]
Take this.
[nl2]Use it wisely!
[en1]
The plant must have
[nl2]assumed human form!
[nl3]You have to find it![np]
[scl]Will you help me?[X$6A]
[scl]    Okay
[scl]    Noooo[X$68]
[en1]
Ooh, what great music![np]
[nl2]I love to drink while
[nl3]listening to this
[scl]song.[np]
[scl]Whaddaya say kids,
[scl]you wanna drink up,
[scl]too?[np]
[scl]This heavy drink will
[scl]put some hair on your
[scl]chests!
[en1]
If you don't hurry up,
[nl2]it'll get dark out~.
[en2]
[F2]Fudge! I lost...
[nl2]Fine, take this Luck

You seem pretty
[nl2]bright.
[nl3]Use this wisely!
[en1]
You? I don't think so.
[nl2]Hah!
[en2]
It used to be a cute
[nl2]little plant like
[nl3]this.
[en2]
...It looks like a
[nl2]map.[np]
[nl3]The numbers must be...
[scl]Floor numbers?
[scl]...There are two.
[en2]
At first I didn't
[nl2]wish... 
[en2]
There are lots of
[nl2]painful seeming
[nl3]thorns.
[en2]
Don't you have
[nl2]something that would
[nl3]help?
[en2]
Don't you have
[nl2]goosebumps?!
[en2]
For some reason...
[nl2]I want to punch it.
[en2]
Haha, I'm glad I
[nl2]secretly brought these
[nl3]swimming goggles![np]
[scl]I'm the only one who
[scl]can enjoy such an
[scl]amazing experience.[np]
[scl]Sorry, but I'm going
[scl]to go diving again
[scl]now...
[en1]
I lost my goggles...
[nl2]...I guess I'll just
[nl3]watch them fish.
[en1]

[nl3]...My... My goggles!
[en2]
Did you know when you
[nl2]want to look at things
[nl3]that are far away,[np]
[scl]you can press [C$02] and
[scl]move the [C$0C] to the thing
[scl]want to check,[np]
[scl]and then press [C$02] to
[scl]check it?
[en2]
I'm so hungry~...
[nl2]Feed me~...[np]
[nl3]Come on, don't just
[scl]stand there!

I'm so hungry~...
[nl2]Feed me~...[np]

[nl2]Heheh~...
[en2]
Those shoes are pretty
[nl2]good.[np]
[nl3]So try kicking lots of
[scl]stuff with them.
[en2]
Want a whiff?
[en2]
If you're boys, why
[nl2]don't you explore the
[nl3]island a little?[np]
[scl]At least get out of
[scl]here!
[en2]
...What does this star
[nl2]mark mean?[np]
[nl3]Is something special
[scl]here?
[en2]
...This seems to
[nl2]indicate where we
[nl3]are...
[en2]
Stop whining and go
[nl2]look for it!
[en2]
What?... You guys look
[nl2]awfully guilty!
[nl3]Well, whatever...[np]
[scl]Until Miss Gina gets
[scl]back,[np]
[scl]go in the tent and
[scl]listen to the egghead's
[scl]boring lecture.
[en1]
Bring the other kids
[nl2]here.
[en2]
Wait...
[nl2]Don't tell me![np]
[nl3]You guys are seriously
[scl]going after Miss Gina,
[scl]aren't you?...[np]
[scl]
[scl]...................
[scl][np]
[scl]Okay, well, if you
[scl]are, at least take
[scl]these walkie-talkies.
[en1]
When your team is too
[nl2]far to hear your
[nl3]whistle,[np]
[scl]equip this and use the
[scl][C$04] button.
[en1]
You guys should just
[nl2]call the mainland.[np]
[nl3]Might as well wait for
[scl]the adults to handle
[scl]the situation.

[nl2]it might be a

It's full of soot.

[nl3]    Not just yet.[X$68]

Luck Rocks sure are
[nl2]strange stones~

It seems like
[nl2]something is hidden
[nl3]beneath this boulder.
[en2]
We've lifted countless
[nl2]boulders already,
[nl3]hohoho...

Oh gosh, what should

[en1]
Agh, my body won't

[nl3]awful...
[en1]
[F2]Received Hassan's
[nl2]great invention, the
[nl3]buster cannon![np]
[scl]I wonder how it works.
[en1]
This cannon has 10
[nl2]times the power of the
[nl3]regular Ant Buster and[np]
[scl]should be able to
[scl]defeat the 「Ant
[scl]Queen.「 When you face[np]

[F2]You sure are nice
[nl2]children![np]
[nl3]I'm sure things will
[scl]start going your way.

..Now we can't move
[nl2]forward. What do we
[nl3]do?
[en2]
It looks too heavy to
[nl2]move, and if we push
[nl3]it inside.. we still[np]
[scl]can't get in. What
[scl]should we do?
[en2]
Yeah! Now we can keep
[nl2]going! Let's find
[nl3]Polly!
[en1]
It seems there is
[nl2]still a room below.
[en2]
Let's save this until
[nl2]we face the Queen.
[en1]
Let's get closer and
[nl2]check it out.
[en2]
Want to play a fun
[nl2]game? Hehehe. Come a
[nl3]little closer.
[en2]
If you want to play,
[nl2]choose Luck Rock from
[nl3]the [C$4A] menu.
[en2]
Alright, I have taken
[nl2]1 Luck Rock. Look
[nl3]carefully at the[np]
[scl]moving panels before
[scl]you kick!

Where were you
[nl2]looking?! You suck so
[nl3]bad! Want to try[np]
[scl]again?

Dummy! You're so
[nl2]unlucky. Try again?

If you don't
[nl2]concentrate, you can't
[nl3]hit the middle!

Oh, you found my 「Kick
[nl2]Slots「 machine. Cool,

Oh, you found my 「Ball

Oh, you found

[nl2] Hurry and kick it.

When there's only one
[en1]
When there's only [num] Luck Rock
[en1]
Did you run into
[nl2]Hassan? To defeat the
[nl3]Ant Queen, you need[np]
[scl]his Buster Cannon!
[en2]
You have to wait for
[nl2]an opening to use your
[nl3]Buster Cannon. Find[np]
[scl]your courage and aim!
[en2]
Dang... there's
[nl2]nothing to do but wait
[nl3]for death, now.

Let's try out that
[nl2]thing Hassan gave us.

Oh nuts.. we have to
[nl2]aim better!
[en1]
[X$79]Charge up with [C$38][X$78]
[en1]
Yikes, it's coming for
[nl2]us!
[en1]
You guys...
[nl2]
[nl3][np]
[scl]   Thanks....
[en1]
The truth is... I
[nl2]wasn't even tied up.
[nl3]See?
[en1]
I was scared of the
[nl2]queen, but I also
[nl3]believed that you[np]
[scl]would come to my
[scl]rescue... As if!
[scl]Dummies! I'm going[np]
[scl]back to the castle
[scl]now.
[en1]
For generations, the
[nl2]monkeys of this island
[nl3]have guarded a secret.[np]
[scl]Today, this great
[scl]responsibility shall
[scl]be passed on to you.
[en1]
[F2]Winky received the
[nl2]「Three Keys「 from the
[nl3]Elder!
[en1]
Have you seen the
[nl2]ancient ship on this
[nl3]island?[np]
[scl]That ship and these
[scl]keys have a strong
[scl]connection...
[en1]
These keys unlock the
[nl2]secret of this island.
[nl3]But more than that--[np]
[scl]They have the power to
[scl]change the lives of
[scl]those who hold them.[np]
[scl]Winky, you must find
[scl]humans who are worthy
[scl]of the keys.
[en1]
Ah yes, Piroc?
[nl2]Are you here, Piroc?
[en1]
Piroc will aid you in
[nl2]your task.
[nl3][np]
[scl]You two must work
[scl]together to protect
[scl]the keys.
[en1]
Oookii! Oookii![np]
[nl2]TL: Bad news, Elder!
[nl3]Humans have come to
[scl]capture us!
[en1]
You must escape,
[nl2]Elder!
[en1]
Oookii! Oookikikikii!![np]
[nl2]TL: They've come for
[nl3]the keys!
[scl][np]
[scl]Winky, Piroc, I'm
[scl]counting on you!
[scl]
[en1]
Piropii. Pirororoo![np]
[nl2]TL: What are you
[nl3]doing?[np]
[scl]Hurry, you need
[scl]to get out of here,
[scl]too![np]
[scl]Gosh, what a dunce.
[en1]
Did the country really
[nl2]return to its previous
[nl3]size? That's a lot to[np]
[scl]swallow...
[en2]
This country returned
[nl2]to normal size, right?
[nl3]I'm going to go check[np]
[scl]it out.
[en1]
Come over here, I have
[nl2]something to tell
[nl3]you...
[en2]
Thanks to you guys, I
[nl2]saw something cool!
[nl3]Here's a secret prize.
[en1]
[F2]You received Luck
[nl2]Rocks from the King![np]
[nl3]He gave you... [C$28][C$1E]
[scl]pieces!! Wow!
[en1]
Can you go see Polly
[nl2]before you leave? She
[nl3]puts on a tough act,[np]
[scl]but she is actually
[scl]lonely on the inside.
[en2]
Polly doesn't really
[nl2]take after her mom...
[nl3]Maybe this is what it[np]
[scl]means to be an adult?
[en2]
The king told me I
[nl2]have to draw Polly
[nl3]next, but without a[np]
[scl]model, I can't do it.
[en2]
[F2]Perfect![np]
[nl2]You've mastered my
[nl3]drawing technique!
[en2]
Customers stopped
[nl2]coming around thanks
[nl3]to those 「Blue Things「[np]
[scl]ant monsters, so
[scl]business is in the
[scl]pits.
[en2]
Oh, if you stay in an
[nl2]inn, when you start
[nl3]the game, choose[np]
[scl]「start from inn.「 You
[scl]can't stay in an inn
[scl]while you're playing.
[en2]
I have something to
[nl2]tell you, so come
[nl3]closer!
[en2]
Thank you so much!!
[nl2]Now the kingdom can
[nl3]become a happy place[np]
[scl]again.
[scl]Oh, leaving already?
[scl]Did you talk to Polly?[np]
[scl]I haven't seen her
[scl]lately...
[scl]You're welcome to[np]
[scl]return whenever you
[scl]like.
[en2]
It looks like a bug
[nl2]carrying a round
[nl3]thing. Is that round[np]
[scl]thing an eagle egg?
[en2]
Two small bugs are
[nl2]rolling an egg.
[en2]
Shaka shaka.
[nl2]TL: Just when we got
[nl3]rid of that eagle,[np]
[scl]it's too heavy and we
[scl]can't move it.
[en2]
Shaka shaka
[nl2]TL: We're eggroll-ers.
[nl3]If we stopped rolling,[np]
[scl]we'd be just plain old
[scl]bugs.
[en2]
So these guys were the
[nl2]thieves. Oh, we can
[nl3]replace that ball with[np]
[scl]this egg! Watch the
[scl]movements carefully
[scl]and press [C$02] to take[np]
[scl]the egg. Press [C$04] to
[scl]cancel.
[en1]
[SP$0127]Take these 3 keys.
[en1]
Crap, they're moving
[nl2]too much!
[en1]
[F2]You received the
[nl2]real Eagle Egg![np]
[nl3]Let's exchange it for
[scl]the ball.
[en1]
Polly has requested
[nl2]your presence at the
[nl3]castle. It must be for[np]
[scl]some kind of 「reward.「
[en2]
Your battle with the
[nl2]「Queen「 will be told
[nl3]in stories for[np]
[scl]generations.
[en2]
Everyone's waiting for
[nl2]you at the castle.
[nl3]Hurry up and see them.
[en2]
Regrettably, there are
[nl2]still some who have
[nl3]not returned from the[np]
[scl]「Blue Things「 nest.
[scl]Could they not have
[scl]been saved?
[en2]
At least now, the
[nl2]「Blue Things「 will
[nl3]stop attacking this[np]
[scl]country. Now, if the
[scl]monsters in the forest
[scl]would shrink a[np]
[scl]little...
[en2]
But we can't let our
[nl2]guard down yet. There
[nl3]are still giant[np]
[scl]monsters out there.
[scl]Stay frosty.
[en2]
The Blue Things'
[nl2]「Queen「 was defeated,
[nl3]but there are still[np]
[scl]giant monsters in the
[scl]forest. We must be
[scl]careful.
[en2]
You guys might get a
[nl2]nice salary out of
[nl3]this.
[en2]
I should have spent
[nl2]more time honing my
[nl3]battle skills, though[np]
[scl]it's too late for that
[scl]now.
[en2]
I just heard from Lady
[nl2]Polly... It's a pretty
[nl3]good name, I guess.
[en2]
Thank you for saving
[nl2]all the soldiers.
[nl3]Everyone is very[np]
[scl]grateful to you.
[en2]
Well, not every
[nl2]soldier made it back,
[nl3]but in that situation[np]
[scl]I guess it was
[scl]impossible.. Pray for
[scl]their souls.
[en2]
The king is waiting
[nl2]for you. Hurry and see
[nl3]him.
[en2]
I think I'll name my
[nl2]army [team] army.
[nl3]Yeah, that sounds[np]
[scl]good.
[en2]
I shudder to remember
[nl2]how I thought I would
[nl3]die in that dark,[np]
[scl]terrible place.
[en2]
Hassan requested that
[nl2]I give you gifts to
[nl3]your heart's content.
[en2]
I bet Polly thinks
[nl2]much better of you
[nl3]now. Why don't you go[np]
[scl]see her?
[en2]
The king is also very
[nl2]pleased. Go see him.
[en2]
Come with me, the king
[nl2]is waiting for you
[nl3]behind the castle.
[en1]
As thanks for saving
[nl2]Polly, you may enter
[nl3]my secret garden. What[np]
[scl]do you think? I tried
[scl]to combine East and
[scl]West in this rock[np]
[scl]garden.
[en2]
Hmm? This garden? It's
[nl2]my first time seeing
[nl3]it as well, but[np]
[scl]doesn't the ball in
[scl]the middle give you
[scl]the willies?
[en2]
Caesar said you kids
[nl2]did a good job, and
[nl3]not to forget how to[np]
[scl]paint.
[en2]
Could it be.. is it
[nl2]possible!? We need to
[nl3]talk to Hassan.
[en2]
You wish to consult
[nl2]with me? Then come
[nl3]closer.
[en2]
..Yes, it's
[nl2]possible... yes, that
[nl3]explains everything..[np]
[scl]I see, it's making us
[scl]dwarves! And .. that
[scl]ball is the cause of[np]
[scl]everything! Wait here
[scl]a moment.
[en1]
Actually.. how do I
[nl2]say this... the king
[nl3]has stated that you[np]
[scl]boys may take the ball
[scl]as your prize. It
[scl]might seem like it's[np]
[scl]for our convenience,
[scl]but please help us get
[scl]rid of it.
[en1]
That ball was found in
[nl2]the forest before this
[nl3]kingdom shrank. It[np]
[scl]wasn't always that
[scl]big, come to think of
[scl]it.
[en2]
We could float it into
[nl2]the sky and let the
[nl3]wind carry it! ....[np]
[scl]psyche! Something that
[scl]heavy won't float.
[en2]

[nl2]I wonder how that
[nl3]happened...
[en2]
What if you lifted it
[nl2]with teamwork? But the
[nl3]ship is awfully far,[np]
[scl]isn't it...
[en2]
We have to do
[nl2]something right away!
[en2]
That's right! The
[nl2]giant eagle that
[nl3]attacked us was[np]
[scl]looking for an egg!
[scl]If we painted this
[scl]ball the same pattern[np]
[scl]as an egg... maybe
[scl]the eagle would take
[scl]it away for us![np]
[scl]Will you try it?
[scl]    Yeah, we will.
[scl]    I can't remember. [X$68]
[en1]
You need to go to the
[nl2]eagle's nest and look
[nl3]at his eggs! Hurry!
[en1]
Now let's go back to
[nl2]the ball and paint it
[nl3]like the eggs!
[en2]
Let's get close and
[nl2]give it a try.
[en2]
I wonder if this will
[nl2]work... won't hurt to
[nl3]try.
[en2]
Are you ready? I'm not
[nl2]sure if this will
[nl3]work, but it's our[np]
[scl]best shot.[np]
[scl][X$6A]    We'll try it.
[scl]    I can't remember.[X$68]
[en1]
[SP$00D3]Let's start. Remember
[nl2]Caesar's books. What
[nl3]color is first?[np]
[scl][X$6A]    Deon red
[scl]    Jack blue
[scl]    Max green[X$6E]
[en1]
Who is next?
[nl2]    Deon red
[nl3]    Jack blue[X$68]
[en1]
Who is next?
[nl2]    Deon red
[nl3]    Max green[X$68]
[en1]
Who is next?
[nl2]    Jack blue
[nl3]    Max green[X$68]
[en1]
It seems like the
[nl2]eagle won't come.
[nl3]Maybe the pattern is[np]
[scl]wrong? Why don't you
[scl]go look at the eggs
[scl]again.
[en1]
Maybe you should read
[nl2]Caesar's book 「How to
[nl3]Paint「 in the[np]
[scl]archives.
[en2]
[SP$0319]What's
[nl2]wrong? Just calm down,
[nl3]focus, and look at the[np]
[scl]egg. Okay?
[en1]
[SP$0119]Caww caw!
[nl2]TL: I found it! My
[nl3]egg!!
[en1]
[SP$0119]Caw! cawcaw!
[nl2]TL: My poor little
[nl3]egg! Let's go home~
[en1]
Hurray! The eagle took
[nl2]the ball away! Hurry
[nl3]to the nest and take[np]
[scl]it back!
[en1]
Oh, right, no one is
[nl2]allowed to use the
[nl3]electric switch[np]
[scl]anymore. It seems
[scl]broken.
[en2]
Hey, this game is only
[nl2]for someone who knows
[nl3]how to kick.
[en2]
Huh? You don't have
[nl2]any Luck Rocks left,
[nl3]chump. ... Fine, I'll[np]
[scl]take pity on you and
[scl]give you [num] Luck
[scl]Rock. You should quit[np]
[scl]while you're ahead.
[en1]
Received [num] Luck Rock
[nl2]from Jam. Jam might be
[nl3]nicer than Jim!
[en1]
Okay, you got lucky
[nl2]that time. Try again?
[nl3]Don't run out on me,[np]
[scl]now.
[en1]
[X$6A]Received [X$6B] Luck Rocks.
[en1]
Listen to Winky.[np]
[nl2]He's not usually very
[nl3]useful,[np]
[scl]but this time his
[scl]instincts seem spot
[scl]on.
[en2]
Ooo ooo![np]
[nl2]TL: Make Indio and
[nl3]daughter happy.[np]
[scl]Be careful! Bye-bye.
[en2]
Ooo ooo aah!
[nl2]TL: Find man in charge
[nl3]on island.[np]
[scl]He somewhere cramped.[np]
[scl]Poor guy.
[en2]
Ooo ooo aah![np]
[nl2]TL: Little king in
[nl3]distress.[np]
[scl]Tell him why so small.
[en2]
Ooo ooo!
[nl2]TL:
[en2]
Which one?
[nl2]Show me!
[en2]
Great, let's go find
[nl2]the last [C$22] crystal
[nl3]balls. After the ship[np]
[scl]leaves you won't be
[scl]able to return to this
[scl]island, so make sure[np]
[scl]you've done everything
[scl]you want to do here.
[scl]When you're ready,[np]
[scl]start her up!
[en2]
Great, let's go find
[nl2]the last crystal ball.
[nl3]Do you have enough[np]
[scl]Luck Rocks? You can
[scl]take it from here.
[en2]
Okay, now everything
[nl2]is in order. Let's
[nl3]head back to the[np]
[scl]island!
[scl] ...........?!
[en2]

[nl2] Hurry and show Piroc!
[en2]
We've arrived at an
[nl2]island!
[en1]
Ooo! Eee![np]
[nl2]TL: Move ship to
[nl3]save teacher!
[scl]Hurry! Hurry!
[en1]
[SP$033A]Chirpoo![np]
[nl2]TL: Come on, Winky,
[nl3]you have to explain
[scl]from the beginning.
[en1]
The door in the cave
[nl2]can't be opened using
[nl3]only one Crystal Ball.

[en1]
In order to open the
[nl2]door, you need [C$24]
[nl3]more Crystal Balls.[np]
[scl]Don't blame me, it's
[scl]the first puzzle left
[scl]by Captain Maverick.[np]
[scl]We can use this ship
[scl]to track down the
[scl]other [C$24] balls.[np]
[scl]It's the only way to
[scl]save your teacher.[np]
[scl]Otherwise, you'll end
[scl]up like those pirates.[np]
[scl]So, how about it?
[scl]Do you understand?[np]
[scl]    Yes
[scl]    No[X$68]
[en1]
Don't you understand
[nl2]anything?...[np]
[nl3]Seriously, it's like
[scl]there are FOUR
[scl]Winkys before me.
[en1]
Let me see the Crystal
[nl2]Ball.[np]
[nl3]It should show the
[scl]position of the next
[scl]Crystal Ball...[np]
[scl]Sorta like a compass.
[en1]
Next, you need to put
[nl2][X$6B] Luck Rocks in
[nl3]the furnace below[np]
[scl]decks. Then pull the
[scl]giant lever.
[en2]
It looks like you've
[nl2]filled the furnace
[nl3]below decks. Now, pull[np]
[scl]the lever.
[en2]
After you put in the
[nl2]Luck Rocks, pull the
[nl3]lever.
[en2]
Fill furnace down
[nl2]stairs. Hurry! Hurry!
[en2]
After you get the ship
[nl2]moving, you have to
[nl3]come here and hold the[np]
[scl]wheel steady.
[scl]Otherwise, we'll never
[scl]reach the next island.
[en2]
We all in this
[nl2]together, friends,
[nl3]friends.
[en2]
Hold her steady!
[en2]
Why don't you go relax
[nl2]outside until we reach
[nl3]the next island?
[en2]
Know what next?
[nl2]Oooooooo-Ahhhh!
[nl3]What next? What next??
[en2]
The ship is listing
[nl2]out of control...[np]
[nl3]When the compass is
[scl]pointing straight
[scl]ahead,[np]
[scl]that's when you'll need
[scl]to lock in the course.[np]
[scl]Take hold of the helm!

[en2]
[X$79]  Press to lock on.
[nl2]        [C$12][X$7E]
[en1]
The island with the
[nl2]next crystal ball must
[nl3]be this way.
[en2]

[nl2] It's locked on.
[en2]
It looks like we can
[nl2]just barely reach it.
[en2]

[nl2] Pull the lever!
[en2]
Do together!
[nl2]Hurry! Hurry!
[en2]
[SP$0119]Kweh!
[nl2]TL: I'll never leave
[nl3]my eggs again!
[en2]

[nl2] This is a real egg...
[en1]
[SP$0119]Kweh?!
[nl2]TL: What's going on?
[nl3].. there are 4 eggs?
[en1]
[SP$0119]Kweh!!
[nl2]TL: This one isn't
[nl3]mine!!
[en1]
[SP$0119]Kweh!
[nl2]TL: Wow, that almost
[nl3]fooled me.  I'm taking[np]
[scl]my egg back!
[en1]
[SP$0119]Kweh~
[nl2]TL: Stay away from my
[nl3]eggs.
[en2]
Let's get back to the
[nl2]ship right away.
[en2]
What are you doing?
[nl2]Hurry up and get over
[nl3]here.
[en2]
Did you put the Luck
[nl2]Rocks in the furnace?
[nl3]If you need more,[np]
[scl]I'll give you mine.
[scl]    Yes, please.
[scl]    Don't need you![X$68]
[en1]
Well fine, then go
[nl2]below decks and
[nl3]prepare for departure![np]
[scl] .. Imbecile!
[en2]
You guys have [X$6C]
[nl2]Luck Rocks, so you
[nl3]need [X$6B] more.[np]
[scl]Here you are.
[en1]
Received [X$6B] Luck
[nl2]Rocks from Polly!
[en1]
You guys are lazy
[nl2]pigs! Hurry up and get
[nl3]down below!
[en1]
Did you already fill
[nl2]the furnace? Hurry up
[nl3]if you haven't, you[np]
[scl]don't have any time to
[scl]waste, do you?
[en2]
[SP$0017]
[nl2]... Just kidding. I'm
[nl3]not going. I really[np]
[scl]want to go with you
[scl]all, but I can't leave
[scl]my father alone. My[np]
[scl]journey ends here...
[en1]
Ooh aah!
[nl2]TL: That girl was a
[nl3]little scary...
[en2]
Chirpy chirp
[nl2]TL: I wonder if she
[nl3]still wants to travel[np]
[scl]with us.
[en2]
There are two polka
[nl2]dot eggs. It looks
[nl3]like another egg would[np]
[scl]fit in the nest.
[en2]
I wonder if whoever
[nl2]sailed this ship ran
[nl3]it alone?
[en2]
It looks like it would
[nl2]take a lot of power to
[nl3]move this...
[en2]
This ship's captain
[nl2]sat here, I guess.
[en2]
Maybe those guys who
[nl2]kidnapped Miss Gina
[nl3]would know?
[en2]
Alright, let's flip
[nl2]this one.
[en1]
Chirp chirpy![np]

Chirpy chirpy.[np]
[nl2]TL: Good job![np]
[nl3]Now we can go to the
[scl]next island!
[en1]
The island I just came
[nl2]from was crazy~![np]
[nl3]They were having some
[scl]horrible drought.[np]
[scl]The people and fields
[scl]were just dry as dust.[np]
[scl]It used to be such a

[scl]Oh, I've talked your

[scl]Toodleloo~!
[en1]
I hear a lot of my

[nl2] Something is coming..
[en2]
[SP$0119]Caww!
[nl2]TL: A storm's brewin'!
[nl3]Take shelter!
[en2]
Look outside! You have
[nl2]to lock the wheel
[nl3]before we're swept[np]
[scl]away!
[en2]
The lock was broken!
[nl2]Fix it! Fix it!
[en2]

[nl2] It's not even winter.
[en2]

[nl2] Cold! Cold!
[en2]
It has to be a little
[nl2]cold!
[en2]
Excuse me? You'll set
[nl2]me up with a girl who
[nl3]can 「show me a good[np]
[scl]time「?! I'm married,
[scl]you know!
[en2]

[nl2] Do something!!

Something is blocking

Maybe this is blocking
[nl2]our path?
[en2]
Ooh ooh!
[nl2]TL: Come here! Fast!
[en2]
We're searching this
[nl2]island for some lost
[nl3]kids! Do you know[np]
[scl]anything about them?
[scl]They were called
[scl][team] Team, and one[np]
[scl]of them had that

[scl]aren't..?
[en2]
We're back at the

[en2]
[SP$0010].. I wonder
[nl2]how Polly is doing.
[en2]
It seems like Polly
[nl2]might jump out at any
[nl3]moment...
[en2]
This robot and this
[nl2]whole island are
[nl3]pretty strange. I have[np]
[scl]a weird feeling. And
[scl]we can't find those
[scl]missing kids.
[en2]
It seems like stuff
[nl2]went to pot after we
[nl3]left.
[en2]
..There's no response.
[nl2]It must be broken.
[en2]
It seems like someone
[nl2]was growing tomatoes
[nl3]here. I wonder if it's[np]
[scl]connected to this case
[scl]somehow.
[en2]
There's a path through
[nl2]here. It seems to lead
[nl3]to the opposite side[np]
[scl]of the island, but
[scl]it's a pretty old
[scl]road.
[en2]
The pipe is connected
[nl2]to the lake up
[nl3]there... when we came[np]
[scl]here, all the pipes
[scl]were connected so the
[scl]lake water would run[np]
[scl]down to the ocean. Why
[scl]would someone do that?
[en2]
If you understand,
[nl2]then don't get in the
[nl3]way of a man at work.
[en2]
This whole thing must
[nl2]be Blue's doing. His
[nl3]cohorts are keeping[np]
[scl]their mouths shut,
[scl]though.
[en2]
If you want to go
[nl2]through here, you need
[nl3]the colonel's[np]
[scl]permission.
[en2]
Hurry up and put
[nl2][X$6B] Luck Rocks in
[nl3]the furnace below!!
[en2]
Hurry and save Miss
[nl2]Gina!
[en2]
Push the lever! We
[nl2]have to save Miss
[nl3]Gina!
[en2]
We can handle things
[nl2]until we reach the
[nl3]island. Why don't you[np]
[scl]go outside and get
[scl]some fresh air, [team]
[scl]Team?
[en2]
We can handle things
[nl2]until the next island!
[en2]
[team] Team, pull the
[nl2]lever!!
[en2]

[nl2]    Team work!
[en2]
And Piroc is on this
[nl2]ship, isn't he? Tell
[nl3]him I'll visit him[np]
[scl]again sometime. Bye!
[en1]
Hurry and push the
[nl2]lever!
[en2]
Fugo fugogo.
[nl2]TL: If you have
[nl3]something to say, come[np]
[scl]a little closer. I
[scl]won't bite....
[en2]
..Hey, wasn't our
[nl2]teacher with you? ...
[nl3]Who? Miss Gina, duh!![np]
[scl]Don't make me say lame
[scl]stuff like that!
[en2]
By the way, what
[nl2]happened to Miss Gina?
[nl3]Wasn't she with you?[np]
[scl].... Is she really
[scl]lost?!
[en2]
Oh, you guys are okay.
[nl2]But what about Miss
[nl3]Gina? Wasn't she with[np]
[scl]you? You want to go in
[scl]the cave ahead? No
[scl]way, it's dangerous in[np]
[scl]there. I can't let
[scl]some kids in there.
[en2]
By the way, what
[nl2]happened to Miss Gina?
[nl3]Wasn't she with you?[np]
[scl]... She's really
[scl]missing? .. You want
[scl]permission from the[np]
[scl]Colonel to enter the
[scl]cave? .. What on
[scl]earth? What's in the[np]
[scl]cave? You can't tell
[scl]me? ... Okay, just
[scl]give me a minute.
[en1]
Get close and give it
[nl2]a good look.
[en2]
Here you go, the
[nl2]colonel's permission
[nl3]slip. ... I can't go[np]
[scl]with you? Are you kids
[scl]really going to be
[scl]okay on your own? ..[np]
[scl]Okay then, here you
[scl]go.
[en1]
Pretty good, right? If
[nl2]you get busted, just
[nl3]run away, okay?
[en1]
[F2]Received the Colonel's
[nl2]Permission Slip.[np]
[nl3]This teacher is...
[scl]A little bit...
[scl]Insubordinate...??
[en1]
You don't know
[nl2]anything about your
[nl3]teacher's whereabouts?[np]
[scl]Nothing at all...? You
[scl]should tell me
[scl]anything you know.
[en2]
I get the sense you
[nl2]boys have an important
[nl3]task. I don't know[np]
[scl]what it is, but give
[scl]it your all!
[en2]
Myuu! Minoo
[nl2]TL: I .. HATE.. you!!!
[nl3]I'd give my coat to[np]
[scl]anyone else!!
[en2]
Umm.. it might be
[nl2]broken?
[en2]
Look at the door
[nl2]behind you. That is
[nl3]the only way out of[np]
[scl]here. You can't go
[scl]back now. What will
[scl]you do?[np]
[scl] -Captain Maverick
[en1]
[X$6A]Good luck you
[nl2]guys! Miss Gina is in
[nl3]your hands now!
[en1]
The door is closed for
[nl2]all eternity. There is
[nl3]no way out for you.
[en2]
Look around the
[nl2]village. There should
[nl3]be a clue leading to[np]
[scl]the crystal ball!
[en1]
Why don't you show
[nl2]those documents to
[nl3]someone who knows a[np]
[scl]lot about plants?
[scl]Here.... 
[scl] aren't I a nice guy?
[en1]
You know, withholding
[nl2]documents is very
[nl3]suspicious!
[en1]
The village manager
[nl2]doesn't meet anyone
[nl3]without an appointment[np]
[scl]by phone. If you place
[scl]that wood splinter
[scl]back into the sign,[np]
[scl]you should be able to
[scl]figure out the phone
[scl]number.
[en1]
Hurry and get back to
[nl2]the ship! But if you
[nl3]want more Luck Rocks,[np]
[scl]look for the monkeys
[scl]on the island. Good
[scl]luck!
[en1]
If the grass is
[nl2]blocking your path,
[nl3]kick it out of the[np]
[scl]way!
[en1]
I'll let you in on a
[nl2]secret. Everything has
[nl3]a weak point. Look[np]
[scl]closely at moving
[scl]things.
[en1]
Hurry back to the
[nl2]village! Prof. Marlowe
[nl3]has made a discovery!
[en1]
Why don't you try
[nl2]spraying various
[nl3]things?
[en1]
What's going on? Let's
[nl2]try asking Mr. Smith!
[en1]
Did you try recording
[nl2]a mouse's squeak and
[nl3]playing it for one of[np]
[scl]the villagers? You
[scl]might find out who
[scl]Mike is that way!
[en1]
The guy you met
[nl2]outside the cave was
[nl3]looking for you!
[en1]
Did you talk to all
[nl2]the villagers? Don't
[nl3]forget to check lots[np]
[scl]of things with the [C$02]
[scl]button, too~
[en1]
Instead of eating the
[nl2]meal yourselves, what
[nl3]if you tried to give[np]
[scl]it to someone else? It
[scl]seems spicy, so
[scl]they'll probably need[np]
[scl]water afterward. Come
[scl]to think of it, wasn't
[scl]there water[np]
[scl]underground by the
[scl]cacti? But it seemed
[scl]awfully salty!
[en1]
Wow, stuff is getting
[nl2]out of control! After
[nl3]spraying the parasite[np]
[scl]with salt water, you
[scl]can try punching it
[scl]with Max. If Max[np]
[scl]doesn't have boxing
[scl]gloves, you need to
[scl]find some!
[en1]
Oh no, did you look at
[nl2]the X-Ray? Jack, do
[nl3]something!
[en1]
Did you meet the small
[nl2]people who were
[nl3]attacked by an eagle?[np]
[scl]I suspect they may be
[scl]related to Polly
[scl]somehow!
[en1]
It seems the people of
[nl2]this island are being
[nl3]assaulted by giant[np]
[scl]bugs and animals. How
[scl]did they get so big?
[en1]
Boy, what a handful.
[nl2]We have to collect 5
[nl3]objects.. for now,[np]
[scl]let's choose one of
[scl]the following 3: 
[scl]Frog tail ・ shell[np]
[scl]Gold drop ・ coat
[scl]Silver thread ・
[scl]painting tools[X$6E]
[en1]
Frogs don't actually
[nl2]have tails, but the
[nl3]frog in the forest[np]
[scl]cherishes his. If you
[scl]listen to his problem
[scl]and follow the power[np]
[scl]cable back to the
[scl]castle, you should
[scl]find a way to solve it[np]
[scl]and convince him to
[scl]give you his treasure.
[scl]As far as the Forest[np]
[scl]Shell, that's a snail
[scl]shell. This is the
[scl]season snails like to[np]
[scl]change their homes.
[scl]Answer the roly poly
[scl]bug's questions[np]
[scl]correctly, and then
[scl]find a house a snail
[scl]might like in the[np]
[scl]city.
[en1]
The 「Golden Drop「
[nl2]refers to honey. There
[nl3]are 3 bees in the[np]
[scl]forest, and one of
[scl]them is easily
[scl]startled. You can[np]
[scl]scare him to get a
[scl]drop, but you need to
[scl]see where it falls and[np]
[scl]remember the location.
[scl]The Forest Coat is a
[scl]coccoon's shell. The[np]
[scl]cocoons in this forest
[scl]are very fashionable
[scl]and will throw away[np]
[scl]their coat if it gets
[scl]dirty. You should have
[scl]an item for that,[np]
[scl]right?
[en1]

[scl]君たちそれぞれの「とくい技」を使ってごらん.
[en1]

[scl]ちょっとやり方がちがうけどね.
[en1]
You've done a lot of
[nl2]things, but there's no
[nl3]trace of the crystal[np]
[scl]ball. Maybe you should
[scl]talk to Solomon.
[en1]
Oh no, it's awful.
[nl2]Polly is being held in
[nl3]the lowest level of[np]
[scl]the ant hill. You'll
[scl]have to find holes in
[scl]the ground to go to[np]
[scl]the lower levels. Be
[scl]careful of ants!
[en1]
Did you help the
[nl2]injured soldiers?
[nl3]Search the area near[np]
[scl]the soldiers. Don't
[scl]you have a tool that
[scl]can dig holes?
[en1]
The little boy in town
[nl2]might know how to
[nl3]defeat a giant toy[np]
[scl]robot. Your opening is
[scl]when he turns to the
[scl]side.
[en1]
You have to find the
[nl2]holes leading down
[nl3]that the ants covered[np]
[scl]up. Think back on your
[scl]journey and you should
[scl]realize how to find[np]
[scl]the holes.
[en1]
You can't defeat the
[nl2]queen without a strong
[nl3]weapon from Hassan.[np]
[scl]Did you already
[scl]receive it?
[en1]
It's time to wrap this
[nl2]up. You need the eagle
[nl3]to carry the treasure[np]
[scl]away from the castle's
[scl]secret garden. Do you
[scl]remember what the[np]
[scl]eagle egg looks like?
[scl]Think back to what you
[scl]learned at Caesar's[np]
[scl]house and remember the
[scl]painting order.
[en1]
What are you doing?
[nl2]You've saved Polly's
[nl3]kingdom, but you don't[np]
[scl]have the crystal ball
[scl]yet. Find the real
[scl]eagle egg and take it[np]
[scl]to the eagle.
[en1]
Hurry up and take the
[nl2]egg to the eagle. If
[nl3]you do, I'm sure he'll[np]
[scl]give you the crystal
[scl]ball.
[en1]
There's nothing left
[nl2]to do on this island.
[nl3]Let's hurry up and get[np]
[scl]to the ship. We need
[scl]to continue our
[scl]journey.
[en1]
Piroc! What happened
[nl2]to Piroc?! He's never
[nl3]here when you need[np]
[scl]him. Piroc!!
[en1]
Piroc, you have a lot
[nl2]of Luck Rocks, don't
[nl3]you?
[en1]
Elder!? How could you
[nl2]even suggest... I
[nl3]don't know anything[np]
[scl]about that!
[en1]
You fool! Do you think
[nl2]I'm blind?! You
[nl3]rascal! Even if you[np]
[scl]have them, they won't
[scl]do anything for you.
[scl]Use them so the humans[np]
[scl]can get safely home,
[scl]or else!!
[en1]
.. Fine! Darn, I can't
[nl2]lie to the elder. I
[nl3]get it, we're going[np]
[scl]now.
[en1]
You're going to go
[nl2]fire up the engine?
[nl3]Leave it to us! Let's[np]
[scl]go, Jim.
[en1]
It takes 3 of you?
[nl2]Don't worry, I'm at
[nl3]least as strong as two[np]
[scl]of you.
[en1]
Miss Gina!! Leave it
[nl2]to me! Let's go, Jim!
[en1]
Arnold oughtta be
[nl2]ashamed of himself,
[nl3]acting like that at[np]
[scl]his age. He must be in
[scl]「L「 with Miss Gina.
[en1]

[nl2] Jim, get down here!!!
[en1]
Now we must say our
[nl2]farewells. Winky, come
[nl3]off the ship!
[en1]
What, you got
[nl2]something to say? From
[nl3]now on, I'm the main[np]
[scl]character! Get ready
[scl]for King Blue's story!
[en1]
Hey, why is it getting
[nl2]smaller!? Stop it!
[nl3]Don't just end on me!!
[en1]
Dangit, I'll remember
[nl2]this!!
[en1]

[nl2] ..That's fishy.
[en2]
Well isn't that quite
[nl2]an item![np]
[scl]    Okay.
[scl]    Nevermind.[X$68]
[en1]
What? Then show me
[nl2]something else.
[en2]

[nl2]よし!じゃ「こうしょう成立」ってことで・・・
[en1]
Is that weirder than
[nl2]my mom's hairstyle?
[en2]
Could that person
[nl2]be... no, it couldn't
[nl3]be. Forget I said[np]
[scl]anything.
[en2]
Our dad is cool, isn't
[nl2]he?
[en2]

[nl2] Captain, forgive me!
[en2]
Benson, take care of
[nl2]these children,
[nl3]please!!
[en2]

[nl2] Look at our boy!
[en1]
Don't forget that Miss
[nl2]Gina said all 3 of us
[nl3]have to stay together!
[en2]
Come closer and show
[nl2]it to me!
[en2]
You've disgraced our
[nl2]royal family. You kids
[nl3]must face your[np]
[scl]punishment!
[en2]
It's a picture of
[nl2]Polly's dad, the king.
[en2]
Let's get close and
[nl2]check it out.
[en2]
This toy robot is
[nl2]enormous...
[en2]
Teamwork takes all 3
[nl2]of us!
[en2]
They look impossible
[nl2]to move...
[en2]
If my dog eats
[nl2]anything, he falls
[nl3]straight asleep!
[en1]

[nl2] Not!
[en2]
Is he alive..? Let's
[nl2]get closer and check.
[en2]
.. it's a tomato.
[nl2]That's a relief.
[en2]
Let's get closer and
[nl2]read it.
[en2]
Let's give it a closer
[nl2]look.
[en2]
It's a strangely
[nl2]circular egg.
[en2]
By the way.. do you
[nl2]remember me?
[en2]

[nl2] Hey, broo!
[en2]
[X$6A][SP$020D]
[nl2]You don't have items.
[en2]
Did you open the blue
[nl2]chest? If you use what
[nl3]came out of it from[np]
[scl][C$4A], you can
[scl]control the robot!
[en1]
Push the 4 switches
[nl2]inside the cave with
[nl3][C$48]! Make the[np]
[scl]strongest boy the
[scl]leader.
[en1]

[nl3]と思ってるんだい?
[en1]
You can use the rope
[nl2]with [C$4A]. Use it
[nl3]near the pushable[np]
[scl]boulder!
[en1]

[nl3]あるから,君達には乗れないよ~!
[en1]
You're an
[nl2]embarrassment, Max.
[en2]
Did you go inside the
[nl2]mansion? There are a
[nl3]lot of clocks inside,[np]
[scl]right? According to
[scl]Indio's memo, set it
[scl]to 9:30 and then[np]
[scl]10:30.
[en1]
Maybe the person who
[nl2]came out of the clock
[nl3]was the man in the[np]
[scl]photograph? Which
[scl]means, that room must
[scl]be a time room! If you[np]
[scl]look around in there,
[scl]maybe you can find the
[scl]time machine! The[np]
[scl]purple clock looks
[scl]pretty suspicious.
[en1]
Find the man from the
[nl2]lake and show him the
[nl3]penguin! He might be[np]
[scl]happy enough to give
[scl]you a gift.
[en1]
Did you listen to
[nl2]Indio? I'm sure he'll
[nl3]be surprised if you[np]
[scl]show him what you
[scl]found at the cemetery.
[en1]
Did you show Benson
[nl2]the picture? I'm sure
[nl3]that will make him[np]
[scl]believe you.
[en1]
Benson knows all about
[nl2]the Mammoth Brothers,
[nl3]so why don't you ask[np]
[scl]him to show you
[scl]around?
[en1]
Check for Benson's
[nl2]sign with the
[nl3]telescope in the[np]
[scl]bandit hideout. Head
[scl]whichever direction
[scl]his sign is. Be sure[np]
[scl]to use teamwork.
[en1]
Speaking of Luck
[nl2]Rocks, do you have a
[nl3]good stash? You'll[np]
[scl]need a lot to defeat
[scl]the bandits.
[en1]
Check out the Mammoth
[nl2]Brothers with the [C$02]
[nl3]button!
[en1]
Benson's final words
[nl2]must be hidden
[nl3]somewhere in the[np]
[scl]village! If you follow
[scl]his instructions,
[scl]you'll receive the[np]
[scl]crystal ball.
[en1]
Try talking to the man
[nl2]near the gorilla.
[en1]
There's a place to
[nl2]peek into John's
[nl3]house. Did you find[np]
[scl]it? Everyone has
[scl]secrets!
[en1]
Are you stuck in the
[nl2]cave with the mice?
[nl3]Try catching the daddy[np]
[scl]mouse with your
[scl]fishing rod and then
[scl]pull gently.
[en1]
The crystal ball is in
[nl2]the underground cave!
[nl3]Hurry and get it!
[en1]
Don't forget to give
[nl2]Hassan the items you
[nl3]find in the forest!
[en1]

[nl2] You should dig here.
[en2]
This is too lame. Only
[nl2]old people like swing!
[en2]
Gramps might be happy
[nl2]to hear this...
[en2]
Find Hassan. He is in
[nl2]the ant colony
[nl3]somewhere. Maybe under[np]
[scl]a boulder.
[en1]
Noses, bird legs, ant
[nl2]legs, spider legs..
[nl3]maybe they're numbers?
[en2]

[nl2] Come closer.
[en2]
.. isn't what I should
[nl2]be saying now!
[en2]
It's a 「Do Not Enter「
[nl2]sign.
[en2]

[nl2] The guys from earlier?
[en2]
You're the oldest
[nl2]brother!
[en2]
Oh, he caught ..
[nl2]something!
[en2]
You're the 2nd
[nl2]brother!
[en2]
It's a suspicious
[nl2]boulder.[np]
[nl3]I think we could lift
[scl]it if we work
[scl]together...
[en2]
It's the monkey from
[nl2]before.
[en2]
Luck Rocks won't come
[nl2]out anymore.
[en2]

[nl2] You're the youngest!
[en2]
Ooh ooh eek!
[nl2]TL: You're late!
[nl3]What's wrong?
[en2]
What are these boards?
[en2]
The footprints stop
[nl2]here. I wonder why.
[en2]
What is this? There
[nl2]are 4 handles.
[en2]
This grass is dried
[nl2]out like a mummy.
[en2]
What a weird robot.
[nl2]It's sprinkling water
[nl3]like it's haywire.
[en2]
Something's written on
[nl2]the ground...
[en2]

[nl2]Grr. Bark bark. Growl.
[en2]
You can't see what is
[nl2]written.
[en2]
Hey!
[nl2]It's the Crystal Ball!
[en2]
It's a pipe.
[en2]

[nl2] Water is pouring out.
[en2]
Now boys, don't do
[nl2]anything too
[nl3]dangerous, alright?[np]
[scl]You don't have to say
[scl]anything. I can see it
[scl]in your eyes.
[en2]
Ah, you were worried
[nl2]about me, so you
[nl3]became a ghost to come[np]
[scl]check on me?!
[en2]
It's a strange rock
[nl2]that floats up and
[nl3]down!
[en2]
Thank you for
[nl2]collecting the
[nl3]firewood, [team] Team.
[en2]
This pipe sure is in
[nl2]the way...
[en2]

[nl2] What is this mark?
[en2]
The plant that
[nl2]attacked me was
[nl3]huge..!
[en2]

[nl2] Huh? There's a hole.
[en2]

[nl2] It's a sign!
[en2]

[nl2] A treasure chest!!
[en2]
I heard from Dorothy
[nl2]that you collected the
[nl3]firewood!
[en2]
The parasite has been
[nl2]cleansed from the
[nl3]Baobab tree.
[en2]
Too bad. The chest is
[nl2]empty.
[en2]
Why is there a door
[nl2]here?
[en2]
Chirpy chirp.
[nl2]TL: You're finally
[nl3]here. From here on,[np]
[scl]the real fun starts.
[en2]
Uh, something came

It's a robot.

Didn't you hear me? I

Good eye there.

[X$6A]It's the same as the

There's an entrance

It's looks like an old

[en2]
It's a switch that you

[nl2] An old mine cart.

There's a hole for

Holy cow! The robot is

[nl2] It's broken!

Good work. Let's keep
[nl2]going! Question 2:
[en1]
Amazing! Only one
[nl2]left. Question 3:
[en1]
There's a small hole.
[en2]

Pegipegi

Who are you? This is

There are lots of

The plant stopped
[nl2]moving! Now's our

[en2]
No way? You dropped

Meena, mi~nar.

Pegi~

[en2]
Sorry, but that pot is

[en2]
Sorry, that pot is
[nl2]empty. You don't have
[nl3]any idea which pot has[np]
[scl]the honey, do you?
[en2]
It's the same guy from
[nl2]before.
[en2]
Woof woof bark!!
[en2]
What business do you
[nl2]have in the manager's
[nl3]office?
[en2]
There's a message...
[en2]
It looks like a
[nl2]medical chart.
[en2]
What is this gross
[nl2]plant? It's moving!!
[en2]
It's an X-Ray machine.
[nl2]I wonder what we can
[nl3]see with it.
[en2]
Did you kids find a
[nl2]rare plant?
[en2]
Hey, let's play? Wanna
[nl2]play?
[en2]
It's a

[X$6A]Even you copy-even kids
[nl2]have 3 people.
[en2]
What's with these

[en2]

[nl2] What is this plant?

[nl2] What is this?
[en2]
Something very

[nl2] What is that?
[en2]
It's a juke box!
[nl2]Sometimes it's nice to

These monkeys are

What's with these

[scl]crying?
[en2]
It looks dicey out

[en2]
Jeez!
[nl2]Embarrassed again!
[en2]
Did you find Mr.

[en2]
It's so dangerous
[nl2]outside I can't get
[nl3]any work done! ..What[np]
[scl]do you want?
[en2]
So... So spice!!
[nl2]Water!!
[en2]
Haven't you seen a
[nl2]creepy plant somewhere
[nl3]else?
[en2]
It seems like this
[nl2]leads to the cave.
[en2]
It's the old man from
[nl2]the management office?
[en2]
[X$6A]Someone came
[nl2]out of the plant! Huh?
[nl3]It's Mr.[np]
[scl]Smith...[SP$0121]Then
[scl]who did we meet in the
[scl]cave earlier?!
[en2]
We were too late! The
[nl2]key to the cave is
[nl3]already gone. Who[np]
[scl]could have done this?
[en2]
Find the plant who
[nl2]turned into a person!
[nl3]He must be in the[np]
[scl]village, I'm sure of
[scl]it!
[en2]
Someone told you I
[nl2]would be afraid of
[nl3]mice? That's silly.
[en2]
I didn't cower in fear
[nl2]at the sound of a
[nl3]mouse's squeak, right,[np]
[scl]tubby? Hehehe... Okay,
[scl]you want to know how
[scl]many townspeople there[np]
[scl]are? Excepting myself
[scl]and Mr. Smith, there
[scl]are [C$2E] people and [C$24][np]
[scl]are women.
[en2]
It says, 「Smith's
[nl2]Journal.「
[en2]
There's a hole here.
[en2]
It's a loud, squeaky
[nl2]mouse.
[en2]
Man, I was working
[nl2]inside, and then Mr.
[nl3]Smith suddenly chased[np]
[scl]me out.
[en2]
Who are you kids?!
[en2]
Grr~! Bark bark!
[nl2]Growl...
[en2]
Why is a plant growing
[nl2]here??
[en2]
A dog's corpse came
[nl2]out. The collar
[nl3]is[SP$0121] the same[np]
[scl]as the dog that
[scl]attacked us.
[en2]
There might be a prize
[nl2]for taking down Bob,
[nl3]you know.
[en2]
[SP$00D3]Wash your
[nl2]face and come back
[nl3]later. I'll take those[np]
[scl]gloves back, too!
[en1]
The ship has stopped
[nl2]safely.
[en2]
Stop right there,
[nl2]travelers! For your
[nl3]crime of kidnapping[np]
[scl]the princess, you will
[scl]be arrested and taken
[scl]to the king to receive[np]
[scl]your sentence.
[en1]
Stop right there,
[nl2]travelers! For your
[nl3]crime of kidnapping[np]
[scl]Polly, you will be
[scl]arrested and taken to
[scl]a cell to await[np]
[scl]punishment. According
[scl]to reports, there were
[scl]3 of you. Where are[np]
[scl]your friends? Someone,
[scl]go and fetch them.
[en1]
How could Polly be
[nl2]kidnapped by such dumb
[nl3]kids... well, at least[np]
[scl]now Polly should
[scl]understand that
[scl]stories of giants are[np]
[scl]nothing but lies.
[en2]
If you were just
[nl2]giants, how did you
[nl3]become tiny like us?[np]
[scl]It's unbelievable.
[en2]
I am sure you were
[nl2]giants. Maybe it was a
[nl3]bad dream.
[en2]
Maybe the reason you
[nl2]guys shrunk is the
[nl3]same reason everything[np]
[scl]around this castle is
[scl]huge...
[en2]
These stairs lead to
[nl2]Princess Polly's room.
[nl3]Without Solomon's[np]
[scl]permission you can't
[scl]enter.
[en2]
This stairway leads to
[nl2]the dungeon. Without
[nl3]Hassan's permission[np]
[scl]you may not enter.
[en2]
Criminals must not be
[nl2]allowed to escape.
[nl3]Quietly await your[np]
[scl]judgement.
[en2]
What are you doing?
[nl2]Follow Hassan's
[nl3]orders.
[en2]
Look at the creatures
[nl2]in the cell there.
[nl3]They're 「Blue Things,「[np]
[scl]giant ants.
[en2]
I've been searching
[nl2]for a way to defeat
[nl3]the 「Blue Things「 for[np]
[scl]a long time and
[scl]finally found a

[en2]
Choose who you will
[nl2]leave behind. If you
[nl3]drag your feet, the[np]
[scl]「Blue Things「 will
[scl]come and destroy us!
[en2]
Don't worry about
[nl2]whoever you leave
[nl3]behind. This dungeon[np]
[scl]is MUCH safer than the
[scl]forest.
[en2]
It's a giant ant! How
[nl2]could an ant get so
[nl3]big?
[en2]
Hassan is the greatest
[nl2]scientist in the
[nl3]kingdom.
[en2]
The forest is outside
[nl2]the castle and to the
[nl3]left.
[en2]
The king is taking a
[nl2]little nap. Don't make
[nl3]a ruckus!
[en2]
This gate leads to the
[nl2]forest.
[en2]
This gate leads to the
[nl2]「Blue Thing「 colony.
[nl3]Those without the[np]
[scl]king's permission may
[scl]not pass.
[en2]
This gate leads
[nl2]outside. The king

[nl2]Our items won't make a
[nl3]dent.
[en2]
Thank you for saving
[nl2]us.
[en2]
Incredible.
[nl2]I've never seen such an
[nl3]impressive battle.[np]
[scl]I'm impressed...
[en2]
Anything's worth a
[nl2]try, I guess.[np]
[nl3]The fact that there
[scl]was another way...[np]
[scl]I can't believe you
[scl]kids thought of that.
[en2]
Hurray! I didn't think
[nl2]it would go so well.
[en2]
This garden will get
[nl2]lonely.
[en2]
That Ball gave life to
[nl2]this garden...
[nl3]Alas, there is nothing
[scl]for it.
[en2]
...Are you leaving so
[nl2]soon?[np]
[nl3]Polly will be
[scl]disappointed...
[en2]
Polly isn't in her
[nl2]room... I wonder where
[nl3]she went?
[en2]
What happened to
[nl2]Polly?[np]
[nl3]...Oh, she's safe?
[scl]I'm so relieved.
[en2]
It's our picture![np]
[nl2]This was painted in
[nl3]blue... red... and
[scl]then green, I think.
[en2]
Welc...
[nl2]Oh, the kids who
[nl3]invaded our kingdom.[np]
[scl]Are you supposed to be
[scl]fuddling around here?
[en2]
What's wrong,
[nl2]children?[np]
[nl3]If you're tired, feel
[scl]free to rest in my
[scl]inn.[np]
[scl]Hassan will take care
[scl]of the bill, so don't
[scl]worry about it.

Fugofugo, fugogo.[np]
[nl2]TL: Can you kick?
[nl3]I'll let 1 kicker

[scl]How about it?[X$6A]
[scl]    Let me pass.
[scl]    I'll come back.[X$68]
[en1]
Look!! You boys were
[nl2]telling the truth!![np]
[nl3]Everything outside the
[scl]castle is returning to
[scl]normal.
[en2]
...Something's moving.
[en2]
Ah! This is an eagle
[nl2]egg!
[en2]
Travelers, thank you![np]
[nl2]Princess Polly has
[nl3]safely returned to the
[scl]castle.
[en2]
Oh! You made it back![np]
[nl2]...I could tell you
[nl3]weren't just any old
[scl]kids.
[en2]
Thank you for saving
[nl2]the other soldiers.[np]
[nl3]Everyone is praying
[scl]for your safety.
[en2]
Did you have any
[nl2]trouble with the 「Blue
[nl3]Ants「?[np]
[scl]How did you manage to
[scl]defeat them?
[en2]
I heard you boys
[nl2]defeated the 「Queen.「
[nl3]I sincerely thank you.
[en2]
You kids are quite
[nl2]impressive.[np]
[nl3]We adults were at a
[scl]total loss, but you
[scl]managed to save us.
[en2]
I heard. You guys are
[nl2]pretty good.[np]
[nl3]Why don't you stay here
[scl]and join the army?
[en2]
Did you already see
[nl2]the king?[np]
[nl3]I'm sure he'll have a
[scl]special reward for
[scl]you.
[en2]
Thank you, [team]      Team.[np]
[nl2]    ...What?...[np]
[nl3]You want to know how I
[scl]know your name?
[en2]
I lost the 「Soldier
[nl2]Blue「 inside the 「Blue
[scl]Things'「 nest.[np]
[scl]Remember me?
[en2]
Very impressive, boys.[np]
[nl2]I hope my children
[nl3]grow up to be like you
[scl]all.
[en2]
Children who know no
[nl2]fear.[np]
[nl3]As long as I live,[np]
[scl]I will never forget
[scl]what [team] Team did
[scl]for my soldiers.
[en2]
Thank you for saving
[nl2]me in their nest.
[nl3]You were like angels.
[en2]
Thank you for saving
[nl2]me in their nest.
[nl3]I'll never forget you.
[en2]
Thank you, [team]
[nl2]Team.[np]
[nl3]If it weren't for you,
[scl]I wouldn't be standing
[scl]here right now.
[en2]
Good job coming back
[nl2]in one piece.[np]
[nl3]I don't want to think
[scl]what would have
[scl]happened to me if you[np]
[scl]hadn't been there,
[scl][team] Team...
[en2]
Hurray![np]
[nl2]I'm shocked that you
[nl3]boys managed to defeat
[scl]the queen all alone!
[en2]
Thank you, travelers.[np]
[nl2]We're terribly sorry
[nl3]for treating you like
[scl]criminals.[np]
[scl]In the confusion, we
[scl]may have overreacted.
[en2]
Oh, you're back!
[nl2]How was the buster
[nl3]cannon?[np]
[nl3]I knew you kids could
[scl]handle it!
[en2]
Oooh, the king's
[nl2]private garden...[np]
[nl3]I had no idea...[np]
[scl]...Well... It's... A
[scl]nice garden, I guess.
[en2]
...Huh?
[nl2]What is this giant
[nl3]ball...?
[en2]
It's what?...
[nl2]What's wrong with the
[nl3]Crystal Ball?
[en2]
What are you saying?!
[nl2]That's...!! You're
[nl3]saying that everything[np]
[scl]outside the castle
[scl]seems huge because WE
[scl]shrunk?!?
[en2]
I heard what you said.
[nl2]Go on and take this
[nl3]「reward.「
[en2]
What will you do? The
[nl2]crystal ball is to
[nl3]large to fit through[np]
[scl]the entrance...
[en2]
The king is sort of
[nl2]lazy. He always
[nl3]delegates his problems[np]
[scl]to others... ah, but
[scl]don't let him know I
[scl]told you.
[en2]
How can you move this
[nl2]giant ball?
[en2]
I wonder if we can
[nl2]combine our power to
[nl3]lift this ball...
[en2]
Did you learn the
[nl2]eagle egg's pattern?
[en2]
I wonder if Solomon's
[nl2]idea will really work
[nl3]and the eagle will[np]
[scl]carry it off...
[en2]
So you have to paint
[nl2]an egg pattern onto
[nl3]this ball...
[en2]
What are you waiting
[nl2]for? Hurry up and find
[nl3]an egg!
[en2]
Oh, the heroes are
[nl2]back. Sounds like you

Chirpy chirp![np]
[nl2]TL: Wow, the 「Yellow
[nl3]Crystal「!!
[scl]Good job.[np]
[scl]I wonder if this ball

[scl]around.
[en2]
Chirpy chirp.
[nl2]TL: The 「Green
[nl3]Crystal.「

How long are you going

It's a lever for the
[nl2]ship's engine.
[en2]
It's a fancy chair.

Weren't you told to go

You need something?
