What's this?!
[en2]
We have to get closer!
[en2]
Message failure.
[en2]
... Huh? How can we
[nl2]hear Miss Gina's
[nl3]voice.. There are two[np]

[en1]
No, not that!

Chirpy chirp!
[nl2]TL: Here we are, home
[nl3]sweet camp. Are you[np]

[en1]
Muuuha! Hayaah! Don't

[nl3]away! Guraaah, this is[np]
[scl]the big one!!

Chirpy chirp

Leave the rest to us.
[nl2]Why don't you guys
[nl3]explore the island?
[en2]
Why don't you explore
[nl2]the island until lunch
[nl3]is ready? You might[np]
[scl]make a new discovery.
[en2]
Huh?! You don't have
[nl2]enough Luck Rock! Come
[nl3]back when you have a[np]
[scl]lot more.

Our leader is a
[nl2]fishing freak, but he
[nl3]has never caught a[np]
[scl]fish before. He only
[scl]pulls up junk.
[en2]
What if we left one
[nl2]strong guy below and
[nl3]the two others tried[np]
[scl]to lift from above it?
[en2]
Our leader is a

[en2]
Eeek ooh!
[nl2]TL: Save me! Save me!
[en2]
Where does this go?
[en2]
It seems that if we
[nl2]push the lever, we can
[nl3]make it rotate. But[np]
[scl]it's too heavy for one
[scl]person.
[en2]
Can't we move it
[nl2]somehow...?
[en2]
The powerful water
[nl2]flow moved the
[nl3]boulder!
[en2]
Oooh!
[nl2]TL: .. wait!
[en1]
It says:
[nl2]「Danger! Pitfall
[nl3]ahead.「
[en2]
Ready! This will trip
[nl2]them up for sure.
[en2]
More junk? Shucks.
[en2]
How can we lift such a
[nl2]large object?
[en2]
If we lift from both
[nl2]sides of the boulder,
[nl3]maybe we can move it.
[en2]
You want a piece of
[nl2]me? Best watch
[nl3]yourself before your[np]

[scl][en2]
[X$6A]To the members

[nl3]Since the ship came[np]
[scl]from town, we're

[scl]waited 2 hours for you[np]

[scl]came. We called the
[scl]police, so let them[np]
[scl]look for Miss Gina.
[scl]You should get a ride
[scl]from them to town,[np]
[scl]too. This year's camp
[scl]really got out of
[scl]hand, but after you[np]
[scl]get back to town,
[scl]let's play soccer

[en2]
Alright, now I will
[nl2]inform [team] of your

[scl]You need to find [C$2A]
[scl]pieces of firewood and
[scl]take them to Dorothy[np]
[scl]in Tent ュ3 so she can
[scl]make lunch. Also,
[scl]there are lots of[np]
[scl]pretty rocks on this
[scl]island. They're called
[scl]「Luck Rocks「 and I[np]
[scl]like them a lot. Well,
[scl]that's all I have to
[scl]say. If you'd like,[np]
[scl]you can press [C$02] on

[scl]Do it together, okay?
[en2]
I am a gentle watering
[nl2]robot. I water dried

[scl]Without a remote, I'm

There are pots below.
[nl2]From this hole you can
[nl3]only see 3 of them. 2[np]
[scl]red pots and 1 blue
[scl]pot.
[en2]
You saved a monkey,
[nl2]but bullied a dog.
[nl3]Monkeys and dogs have[np]
[scl]been rivals since
[scl]ancient times, but I
[scl]am friends with dogs,[np]
[scl]so I'll fight you!
[en2]
Even if it doesn't
[nl2]work, we've come so
[nl3]far. Let's just do it!
[en2]
Ooh ooh aah
[nl2]TL: Thank you, nice
[nl3]boys. I will give you[np]
[scl]what they were after.
[en1]
[F2]You receive some
[nl2]kind of weird keys
[nl3]from the monkey. For[np]
[scl]some strange reason,
[scl]their colors match our
[scl]clothes. What do these[np]
[scl]keys open??
[en1]
I don't see any fish
[nl2]around here...
[en2]
Maybe we could tie
[nl2]them together with a
[nl3]rope.
[en2]
Chirpee chirple
[nl2]TL: On the count of 3,
[nl3]press [C$02], okay?
[en1]
Let's get a running
[nl2]start and then BANG
[nl3]SMASH we can break[np]
[scl]down the door!
[en2]
[F2]You made a
[nl2]ladder!
[en1]
I think there's a
[nl2]keyhole. Let's get
[nl3]closer.
[en2]
Let's get a closer
[nl2]look.
[en2]

[nl2] Woooooooooosh
[en2]
Something's wrong. The
[nl2]3 of us need to line
[nl3]up behind the box.
[en1]
I didn't think so
[nl2]before, but maybe Miss
[nl3]Gina is this way?
[en2]
It looks like we can
[nl2]ride in it, but it
[nl3]only fits one person.
[en2]
It's fast! I guess we
[nl2]can't avoid them if
[nl3]we're together.
[en2]
But how can we get
[nl2]there..?
[en2]
Look, sheriff! Have a
[nl2]piece of this!
[en1]
If we pull it like
[nl2]this, we won't be able
[nl3]to get back out.
[en2]
What? The sheriff was
[nl2]a plant?! But I'm the
[nl3]sheriff. Oh, he[np]
[scl]transformed INTO the
[scl]villagers and attacked
[scl]them!
[en2]
Ooh ooh!
[nl2]TL: Come here! Hurry!
[nl3]Hurry!
[en2]
I believe children can
[nl2]sense people's true
[nl3]feelings, so it was my[np]
[scl]dream to be a teacher
[scl]who could teach
[scl]children to have kind[np]
[scl]hearts.
[en2]
Don't worry, I haven't
[nl2]changed at all. Look,

We can ride on top of
[nl2]it!

[nl2] How does this open..?
[en2]

[nl3]what would that be[np]
[scl]doing here?
[en2]
Fugofugo fuu
[nl2]TL: I know. You want
[nl3]the thing on my back,[np]
[scl]right? Well, I'll
[scl]consider it if you can

[scl]you're ready.
[en1]
Something's not right.
[nl2]We need to position
[nl3]ourselves around the[np]
[scl]lever evenly or we
[scl]can't move it.
[en2]
Something's wrong. All
[nl2]3 of us need to line
[nl3]up in front of the[np]
[scl]pipe.
[en2]
Hey there, tubs. I
[nl2]like husky kids. This
[nl3]will probably be a[np]
[scl]long journey, so let's
[scl]be friends.
[en1]
[X$6A]It's a girl the
[nl2]size of my thumb.
[en2]
[F2]Polly became your
[nl2]friend?! She can help
[nl3]us in places that are[np]
[scl]too small for us. But
[scl]she seems a little
[scl]selfish...
[en1]
Dear [team] Team,
[nl2]How are your studies?
[nl3]It seems I misjudged[np]
[scl]Jim. His actions after
[scl]being teased by Miss
[scl]Gina were completely[np]
[scl]rational. Except for
[scl]you guys not coming
[scl]back, I think our[np]
[scl]actions were correct.
[scl]Either wait for the
[scl]police to come, or[np]
[scl]find a ship and leave
[scl]that island. I wish
[scl]you luck.[np]
[scl]  Keep studying.
[en2]

[en2]
Bowww baa
[nl2]TL: Who's there?! I'll
[nl3]eat you! I'll eat[np]

Then we need to find
[nl2]that crystal ball fast
[nl3]and get out of here![np]
[scl]Hurry!
[en1]
Chirp chirp
[nl2]TL: What's wrong? That
[nl3]will never work. The 3[np]
[scl]of you need to line up
[scl]more closely to it.
[en2]
If I stay here,
[nl2]another dog might try
[nl3]to eat me.. so my[np]
[scl]present to you is
[scl]going along with you.
[scl]I'll stick with tubs[np]
[scl]here.
[en1]
What are you thinking
[nl2]of doing to a lady!?
[nl3]If you don't come[np]
[scl]closer, I won't go
[scl]with you.
[en2]
[X$6A]Yikes, I was
[nl2]about to be eaten!
[nl3]Thanks, giants. Nice[np]
[scl]to meet you. My name
[scl]is Polly.
[en1]
Now hold it, unless
[nl2]all 3 of you are in
[nl3]this room, we can't[np]
[scl]stop the ship. Bring
[scl]everyone here.
[en2]
I wonder if something
[nl2]is at the base of the
[nl3]tree.
[en1]
There are tiny
[nl2]footprints leading to
[nl3]the tree trunk.
[en1]
There's nothing here
[nl2]anymore!
[en2]

[nl2] Where does this go..?
[en2]
[X$6A]Alright, let's combine
[nl2]our power!
[en1]
What is it? I don't
[nl2]know anything.
[en2]
It was all in good

You don't resemble

Ooh ooh!

I'm sure she's still

[scl]gate that badly, find
[scl]John and get the key
[scl]from him.
[en2]
What's this? Oh.. the
[nl2]board is broken so
[nl3]it's impossible to[np]
[scl]read the phone number.
[en2]
What's this? 「Do Not
[nl2]Enter. Direct
[nl3]enquiries to the[np]
[scl]management office.「!
[en2]
[SP$021A]Ooh ooh!
[nl2]TL: Dangit! Did you
[nl3]think we'd run off[np]
[scl]after we lost?
[scl]
[scl]Well, you're right!
[en1]
What on earth is in
[nl2]this? It's awfully
[nl3]heavy.
[en2]
If there's nothing
[nl2]behind it, the machine
[nl3]won't work?!
[en2]
Is Deon really a
[nl2]coward? Look at his
[nl3]heart beating!
[en2]
They even show up on
[nl2]an X-Ray... What are
[nl3]Jack's glasses made[np]
[scl]out of?
[en2]
Max is...
[nl2]... all stomach!?
[en2]
[SP$0138]Just who is
[nl2]in there?!
[en2]
I see, I see. You kids
[nl2]want me to help you
[nl3]with some research.[np]
[scl]Alright, lead the way!
[scl].. Aren't I a nice
[scl]guy?
[en1]
You're too fast!
[nl2]Show your elders some
[nl3]respect!
[en2]
[X$6A]He seems like
[nl2]he's guarding this
[nl3]place.
[en2]
It looks like there
[nl2]used to be a hole
[nl3]here...
[en2]
We sell the Baobab
[nl2]tree's oil in this
[nl3]village. Mr. Smith was[np]
[scl]the one who discovered
[scl]it. If you want to
[scl]know more, you should[np]
[scl]head East to his house
[scl]and ask him
[scl]personally.
[en2]
My baby is sleeping,
[nl2]don't you dare wake
[nl3]him up...
[en2]
Oh no, I'm sorry!
[nl2]Thanks to Mr. Smith
[nl3]the villagers can make[np]
[scl]a living selling tree
[scl]oil, but lately,
[scl]thieves have been[np]
[scl]coming to steal the
[scl]oil. By the way, I'm
[scl]one of them.
[en1]
John's just inside,
[nl2]follow me!
[en2]
Huh!? You can see
[nl2]through the keyhole!
[en2]
Polly: Hey, small and
[nl2]tall! Just what are
[nl3]you trying to force a[np]
[scl]lady to do!? Right,
[scl]darling?
[en2]
Hehehe.. who is John?
[nl2]Don't look at me. John
[nl3]is over there!
[en2]
[SP$0319]Wash off
[nl2]your shame and try
[nl3]again!
[en1]
Just kidding! I AM
[nl2]John! Nuts, you found
[nl3]me. Fine, I'll give it[np]
[scl]back. Let's play again
[scl]sometime!
[en1]
[F2]Received the gate
[nl2]key from John! But you
[nl3]get a lot of keys, so[np]
[scl]it's not that special
[scl]anymore.
[en1]
But really, I just
[nl2]want to try an 「adult
[nl3]game.「
[en2]
There are various
[nl2]numbers. What could
[nl3]they be?
[en2]
Should you try
[nl2]standing there?
[en2]
It looks like it might
[nl2]start moving... gross.
[en2]
Was this part of some
[nl2]experiment..?
[en2]
The ground is still
[nl2]wet here.. it must
[nl3]have broken out[np]
[scl]recently.
[en2]
It's hard to see
[nl2]without getting
[nl3]closer.
[en2]
What happened to your
[nl2]friends? Unless all 3
[nl3]of you are here, the[np]
[scl]ship can't depart.
[en1]
[F2]Just as I
[nl2]suspected! Now we have
[nl3]the management office[np]
[scl]phone number.
[en1]
The guy with the key
[nl2]is... John...!?
[en1]

[nl2] Which one is John!?
[en1]
It says...
[nl2] 1: Latin. 2: Jazz. 3:
[nl3]Rock. 4: Japanese
[en2]

[nl2] Let's go Latin!
[en2]

[nl2] Let's try Jazz!
[en2]

[nl2] I feel like Rock!
[en2]

[nl2] Maybe Japanese?
[en2]
Okay, the engine
[nl2]stopped!
[en1]
The gate is locked and
[nl2]won't open...
[en2]
Uff uff
[nl2]TL: I'm 28 this year..
[nl3]I wish I could tell[np]
[scl]her how I feel...
[en2]
Ooh ooooh
[nl2]TL: I'll sing a love
[nl3]song for him~
[en2]
[SP$021A]Ooh ooh!
[nl2]TL: Hehe, let's be
[nl3]mean to those kids![np]
[scl]But if you hear the

[scl]We don't want him[np]
[scl]getting mad at us.
[en2]
[SP$021A]Ooh ooh!
[nl2]TL: I could listen to
[nl3]Marie's love song all[np]
[scl]day long~
[en2]
Ooh ooh!
[nl2]TL: Your miraculous
[nl3]voice has captured my[np]
[scl]heart, honey~
[scl]Ooh ooooh~
[scl]TL: Darling, my heart[np]
[scl]was yours as soon as I
[scl]heard your voice~
[en2]
[F2]Now we can go
[nl2]deeper into the
[nl3]island! It's so[np]
[scl]exciting!
[en1]
I'm a thief who steals
[nl2]women's hearts, a
[nl3]heart thief!
[en1]

[nl2] My heart is on fire!
[en2]
[SP$0119]Kweh! kweh!!
[nl2]TL: Who stole my
[nl3]precious egg?! Give it[np]
[scl]back! Give it back!!
[en2]
[X$6A]Those little
[nl2]people are in trouble!
[nl3]... didn't this happen[np]
[scl]before?
[en2]
That bird is all
[nl2]excited about
[nl3]something. Solomon,[np]
[scl]what are you doing?!
[scl]Hurry up and help!
[en2]
H.. Help me!! Hassan,
[nl2]I'm powerless to help
[nl3]you. If only Princess[np]
[scl]Polly were here...
[en2]
Hey Hassan, Solomon.
[nl2]Long time no see. It's
[nl3]me, Polly! Step back,[np]
[scl]I'll handle this.
[en1]
This is probably the
[nl2]switch for the
[nl3]elevator.
[en2]
Ooooh! Princess!! It's
[nl2]been 3 months since
[nl3]you left on your[np]
[scl]journey to find the
[scl]giants. I was.. I was
[scl]so worried...
[en1]
Princess! I'm so glad
[nl2]to see you safe and
[nl3]sound. Hassan was just[np]
[scl]leaving on a journey
[scl]to search for you!
[en1]
I'm sorry to make you
[nl2]all worry, but I'm
[nl3]fine! I brought these[np]
[scl]3 giants with me.
[scl]They're just kids,
[scl]though...... I think[np]
[scl]they can beat the
[scl]「Blue Things「! My
[scl]kingdom is through[np]
[scl]that cave, so come
[scl]with us, okay?
[en1]
I won't be done in so
[nl2]easily!! You may have
[nl3]stepped on me, but now[np]
[scl]it's my turn!!
[en1]
[SP$0119][X$6A]Caww kweh!
[nl2]TL: You stole my egg,
[nl3]didn't you? Give it[np]
[scl]back!
[en1]
Great![SP$0125]I'll
[nl2]take that coin. You
[nl3]can use these gloves[np]
[scl]during the match.
[scl]Alright, good luck,
[scl]chubby!
[en2]
Hey, only the guy with
[nl2]the gloves is allowed
[nl3]in the ring.
[en2]
[SP$00D3]Alright, I'll
[nl2]take you straight to
[nl3]heaven!
[en1]
I'm sorry! We used
[nl2]boxing to make a
[nl3]living... from now on,[np]
[scl]we'll work hard to be
[scl]better parents for our
[scl]twins.
[en2]
John and Ken are
[nl2]musical boys, so if
[nl3]they hear some hard[np]
[scl]beats, they'll start
[scl]dancing.
[en2]

[nl2] You guys!!
[en2]
Haha, you found me
[nl2]out. I can't compare
[nl3]to real twins, I[np]
[scl]guess.
[en1]
Haha, you found out I
[nl2]wasn't sleeping. I
[nl3]want to be a grownup[np]
[scl]so I can stay up late!
[en2]
I don't play with
[nl2]dolls anymore! Cuz I'm
[nl3]a boy!
[en2]
What was that? I can't
[nl2]hear you over the
[nl3]crying baby. Come[np]
[scl]closer...
[en2]
[X$6A]Oh, she stopped
[nl2]crying![X$6A]Thank
[nl3]you! She stopped[np]
[scl]crying when she saw
[scl]her doll. Now you have
[scl]seen all [C$24] females.[np]
[scl]You kids want to know
[scl]more about the
[scl]townspeople? You[np]
[scl]should ask my husband!
[scl]Oh, but you don't know
[scl]who he is. You can[np]
[scl]recognize him because
[scl]he loves my cooking
[scl]more than anything[np]
[scl]else on Earth! Here,
[scl]take this.
[en1]
[X$B8]ou got a chili lunch!
[nl2]It looks spicy!
[en1]
This child won't stop
[nl2]crying and it's
[nl3]driving me nuts![np]
[scl]Please do something!
[en2]
My husband loves my
[nl2]cooking more than
[nl3]anything on Earth. If[np]
[scl]you give him this
[scl]lunch I made, you can
[scl]find him right away.
[en2]
I went to the basement
[nl2]under this house to
[nl3]try to get to the[np]
[scl]cave, but the gate was
[scl]locked! I'm pretty
[scl]sure Mr. Smith has the[np]
[scl]key locked up in a
[scl]safe. If you want to
[scl]enter the cave, you[np]
[scl]need to find Mr.
[scl]Smith. Otherwise, just
[scl]give up! If you find[np]
[scl]him, come tell me
[scl]right away. I'll give
[scl]you something for your[np]
[scl]trouble.
[en2]
It's too far to tell
[nl2]what it is.
[en2]
I'm digging in!
[nl2]
[nl3]Morurh moah muff smuff[np]
[scl]OH MAN! I love my
[scl]darling's cooking. Her
[scl]cooking is the best in[np]
[scl]the world!
[scl]By the way, did you
[scl]find a key[np]
[scl]yet?[SP$0121] What's
[scl]up? A plant that can
[scl]turn into people? Who[np]
[scl]is it turning into?!
[scl]If that's true, that's
[scl]a fine pickle... I[np]
[scl]used to have a weapon
[scl]for defeating bad
[scl]guys, but now all I[np]
[scl]have is this. Still,
[scl]it's better than
[scl]nothing, so I'll give[np]
[scl]it to you.
[en1]
[F2]Received an empty
[nl2]water bottle! This
[nl3]isn't a weapon at all![np]
[scl]It's really walking
[scl]the line of 「better
[scl]than nothing.「
[en1]
All 3 are the same
[nl2]switch.
[en2]
I won't tell outsiders
[nl2]anything about this
[nl3]town.
[en2]
It's too far to see
[nl2]what it is!
[en2]
Ohh, that looks
[nl2]delicious! What?
[nl3]You'll give it to me?[np]
[scl]Thanks! Mmmm..
[en1]
Water!! water!! Quick,
[nl2]bring me water!!!
[en2]

[nl2] Glug glug glug....
[en1]
Okay, there are
[nl2]probably more of them,
[nl3]right? Listen closely[np]
[scl]to what I'm about to
[scl]tell you.
[en2]

[nl2] Why is it in here?
[en2]
It's locked and won't
[nl2]open.
[en2]
[F2]The gate opened!
[nl2]Now we can go into the
[nl3]cave!
[en1]
P.. please forgive me!
[nl2]I'm not really from
[nl3]this island. I'm just[np]
[scl]a thief who heard
[scl]there was a mysterious
[scl]treasure on the island[np]
[scl]so I came to steal it.
[scl]I stole the key, but
[scl]in that room.. there[np]
[scl]was some kind of
[scl]plant, and it.. turned
[scl]into me..! It was so[np]
[scl]scary!
[en1]
Thank you! You saved
[nl2]me! I'm in charge of
[nl3]this village. Call me[np]
[scl]Smith. I was studying
[scl]the parasite that had
[scl]attached itself to the[np]
[scl]Baobab tree, and then
[scl]it suddenly turned
[scl]into me... and then[np]
[scl]attacked me.. oh! I
[scl]have to destroy the
[scl]rest of the parasite[np]
[scl]before it escapes and
[scl]causes more trouble!
[en1]
No one from the
[nl2]village would come
[nl3]into this room. A[np]
[scl]thief must have come
[scl]in here and gotten
[scl]attacked by a plant!
[en1]
Please don't say that!
[nl2]Unless you do
[nl3]something, that[np]
[scl]crystal ball will...
[scl]Please, listen to me!
[en1]
You'll help me?! If
[nl2]you investigate all
[nl3]the villagers, I'm[np]
[scl]sure you can find the
[scl]criminal! First, go
[scl]find a man named Mike.[np]
[scl]He knows how many
[scl]people live in the
[scl]village. Mike is a[np]
[scl]scaredy-cat who
[scl]becomes paralyzed with
[scl]fear just from hearing[np]
[scl]a mouse. [SP$0121]
[scl]You should find him at
[scl]home.
[en2]
You should ask Mike if
[nl2]you want to know how
[nl3]many people live in[np]
[scl]the village. He's a
[scl]coward who can't bear
[scl]to hear a mouse, so he[np]
[scl]never leaves his home.
[en2]
You want to know how
[nl2]many villagers there
[nl3]are? I'll only tell[np]
[scl]that large boy in the
[scl]green...
[en2]
By the way ... Don't
[nl2]say anything about my
[nl3]fear of mice, okay?[np]
[scl]You can have this.
[en1]
[F2]You received a
[nl2]village coin! Is his
[nl3]secret that big of a[np]
[scl]deal? [X$6A] If you
[scl]lose that coin, come
[scl]back anytime. But[np]
[scl]watch out for Jackie,
[scl]he'll take your money!
[en1]
What? Another one?
[nl2]Fine, but keep quiet
[nl3]about that other[np]
[scl]thing, okay?
[en1]
I'll give you a coin
[nl2]whenever you need it,
[nl3]but don't let anyone[np]
[scl]know my secret.
[en2]

[nl2] There's a small hole.
[en2]
It looks like a mouse
[nl2]hole!
[en2]
You need to get
[nl2]closer!
[en2]
Come on out, Mousey!
[nl2]Got some yummy cheeese
[nl3]for you~!
[en1]
Squeak squeak
[nl2]TL: Meh, I've had
[nl3]better.
[en2]
What? I can't hear if
[nl2]you're over there!
[en2]
I can't do my job like
[nl2]this! Can you kids go
[nl3]inside and persuade[np]
[scl]Mr. Smith to let me
[scl]back in?[X$6A][np]
[scl]    Fine
[scl]    I don't wanna[X$68]
[en1]
Thanks a ton! Come see
[nl2]me later and I'll give
[nl3]you a reward. Oh, by[np]
[scl]the way, I think
[scl]there's are a lot of
[scl]Luck Rocks in the tree[np]
[scl]left of here. Okay,
[scl]see you guys later!
[en1]
Don't be like that!
[nl2]There's just a cute
[nl3]little dog inside, so[np]
[scl]don't worry. I'm
[scl]heading back to the
[scl]village now, but if[np]
[scl]you stop by later,
[scl]I'll give you a
[scl]reward!
[en1]
[F2]You got old,
[nl2]holey cheese! ... the
[nl3]only ones who would[np]
[scl]consider this a reward
[scl]are Max or a mouse.
[en1]
If you don't have
[nl2]anything to say, then
[nl3]get out of here!
[en2]

[nl2] He.. he disappeared?!
[en2]
This dog seems kind of
[nl2]weird?!
[en2]

[nl2] It's.. it's moving!
[en2]
The inside of the
[nl2]collar says 「Socks.「
[nl3]This must have been[np]
[scl]the real Socks... so
[scl]then what was that
[scl]other dog we saw?!
[en2]

[nl2] It's busy...
[en2]
Hey, the ring is over
[nl2]there.
[en2]

[nl2]Suddenly, the ship
[nl3]veers alongside!!!
[en2]
Phew, that was
[nl2]close...[SP$0121]
[nl3]Urggh..
[en1]
Why have you come
[nl2]here?!
[en2]
Thanks to you guys I'm
[nl2]a laughing stock
[nl3]throughout the[np]
[scl]kingdom! I'll never
[scl]forgive you!
[en2]
You have incurred the
[nl2]king's wrath. Come
[nl3]with me to fulfill[np]
[scl]your punishment.
[en1]
I'm glad the princess
[nl2]came back, but things
[nl3]have been getting[np]
[scl]stranger and stranger.
[scl]Solomon seems a little
[scl]blue...
[en2]
Did you already talk
[nl2]to Solomon? He talks
[nl3]like a sissy, but he's[np]
[scl]one of the best
[scl]warriors in the
[scl]kingdom.
[en2]
There are all sorts of
[nl2]mysterious animals
[nl3]deep under the ground.[np]
[scl]Perhaps you criminals
[scl]will become a snack
[scl]for them. A pity.
[en2]
First that tomboy
[nl2]caused a ruckus by
[nl3]running away from[np]
[scl]home, and then she
[scl]comes strolling back
[scl]in with 3 criminals.[np]
[scl]Princess Polly is
[scl]quite a handful...
[en2]
I bet you were
[nl2]surprised when you saw
[nl3]the king, weren't you?[np]
[scl]This kingdom has
[scl]always been very hot.
[scl]Why doesn't he take[np]
[scl]off that heavy gown?
[en2]
Besides the 「Blue
[nl2]Things「 there are many
[nl3]gigantic bugs, but[np]
[scl]only the ants have
[scl]formed an army and
[scl]attacked our kingdom.
[en2]
Even if the ants want
[nl2]to attack, they can't
[nl3]thanks to the miracle[np]
[scl]remedy, Ant Buster! If
[scl]I can finish
[scl]production of it, the[np]
[scl]ant threat will be no
[scl]more. Which means...
[scl]your punishment will[np]
[scl]be to search the
[scl]dangerous forest for
[scl]the ingredients. The[np]
[scl]princess says you 3
[scl]are top adventurers
[scl]who can handle any[np]
[scl]challenge, so I'm
[scl]hoping for the best.
[scl]Not only is this your[np]
[scl]punishment, it is a
[scl]personal plea from me.
[scl]I'm sure if you[np]
[scl]succeed, the king will
[scl]reconsider your
[scl]punishment. Will you[np]
[scl]help me?[X$6A]
[scl]    Okay
[scl]    No way![X$68]
[en1]
I'm begging you. If
[nl2]you can help me make
[nl3]the Ant Buster, I'm[np]
[scl]sure the king will
[scl]forgive you.
[scl]Okay?[X$6A][np]
[scl]    Okay.
[scl]    No way![X$68]
[en1]
I'm terribly sorry to
[nl2]hear that. In
[nl3]accordance with our[np]
[scl]kingdom's laws, you
[scl]will be fed to the
[scl]ants. I really hate to[np]
[scl]do it, but...
[en1]
Aren't you brave
[nl2]little boys. Well
[nl3]then, I can't let all[np]
[scl]3 of you leave
[scl]together, but you can
[scl]open the gate on the[np]
[scl]right there.
[en1]
The one who stays
[nl2]behind must stand on
[nl3]the lit block in the[np]
[scl]middle of the cell.
[scl]That will open and
[scl]close the gate.
[en2]
There are 5 things you
[nl2]need to get. Read the
[nl3]blackboard for[np]
[scl]details. Make sure you
[scl]remember them
[scl]properly.
[en2]
If the ants attacked,
[nl2]this small kingdom
[nl3]would be completely[np]
[scl]overwhelmed...
[en2]
Listen carefully to
[nl2]Hassan's sentence and
[nl3]repent your sins!
[en2]
If I don't get home
[nl2]soon, my mom will find
[nl3]out I'm not in bed, so[np]
[scl]later, dudes!
[en1]
You must not run away.
[nl2]If you do, anyone left
[nl3]behind will be fed to[np]
[scl]the 「Blue Things.「
[en2]
You're going to the
[nl2]forest? It might be
[nl3]better to be eaten by[np]
[scl]the 「Blue Things「 ...
[scl]er, I mean, nothing!
[en2]
Princess Polly has
[nl2]retired to her
[nl3]chamber. If you wish[np]
[scl]to see her, you need
[scl]Solomon's permission.
[en2]
Solomon is running
[nl2]errands in town. He's
[nl3]probably at the artist[np]
[scl]Caesar o Enai's house.
[en2]
More and more people
[nl2]are coming back from
[nl3]the forest injured.[np]
[scl]You kids should be
[scl]careful.
[en2]
I.. I almost died! ..
[nl2]I'm staying away... I
[nl3].. I actually really[np]
[scl]hate this duty!
[en2]
A long time ago this
[nl2]town was much larger.
[nl3]One night most of the[np]
[scl]houses just
[scl]disappeared.
[en2]
I've heard rumors that
[nl2]on the other side of
[nl3]the gigantic forest[np]
[scl]there's a town of
[scl]giants. Did you come
[scl]from that town?

[nl2]ribbit!
[nl3]TL: There's[np]
[scl]electricity running

[scl]something! If you do,
[scl]I'll give you what you

[nl2]croaak?
[nl3]TL: What? You want my[np]
[scl]tail? What on earth
[scl]are you talking about?
[scl]I didn't promise[np]
[scl]anything. Moreover, I

[scl]ribbit!

[nl3]TL: I'm sorry!! I[np]
[scl]didn't mean to trick
[scl]you!! Please, take my
[scl]tail, and turn off the[np]
[scl]electricity!!
[en1]
[F2]You received the
[nl2]frog's tail! He must
[nl3]have kept it since he[np]
[scl]was a tadpole. It's
[scl]still kind of
[scl]electrified.

[SP$0124]Ribbity

[SP$0124]Ribbit
[nl2]ribbit.
[nl3]TL: That tail was my[np]
[scl]treasure, so use it
[scl]well!
[en2]
If you want to go, I
[nl2]won't try to stop you.
[nl3]But you'd do well to[np]

This is your last
[nl2]chance. Which pot?
[en1]
Don't try to lie to an
[nl2]adult! The honey is
[nl3]mine. Got a problem?[np]
[scl]Didn't think so.
[en1]
You should listen to
[nl2]what a cacus tells
[nl3]you![np]
[scl]Here's a verse...

[scl]Kick grass, make a[np]

[nl3]have anything above[np]
[scl]the counter. Go ahead
[scl]and choose.
[en2]
You're pretty
[nl2]discerning there, eh?
[nl3]That pot is actually a[np]
[scl]bullet-proof pot worn

[en2]
Hurry and bring the

[nl3]some nerve!
[en2]
You have quite an eye.
[nl2]The shogun of a
[nl3]country called Yapan[np]
[scl]hid that pot in his
[scl]secret treasure stash.
[scl]Do you like it? If you[np]
[scl]want it, choose an
[scl]item you'll trade for
[scl]it from the [C$4A][np]
[scl]panel.
[en2]
I.. I can see
[nl2]Benson...
[en2]
You're a shrewd
[nl2]customer, aren't you?
[nl3]That hat was used by a[np]
[scl]chef in a french
[scl]3-star restaurant for
[scl]30 years. Does it[np]
[scl]tickle your fancy? If
[scl]you want it, choose an
[scl]item you'll trade for[np]
[scl]it from the [C$4A]
[scl]panel.
[en2]
It.. It looks real!
[nl2]How could that be?! It
[nl3]must be my[np]
[scl]imagination!
[en2]
That one isn't for
[nl2]sale. But if you
[nl3]REALLY want it, I[np]
[scl]guess I can make a
[scl]deal. Pick an item
[scl]you'll trade from the[np]
[scl][C$4A] panel.

His clothes look just

[nl3]standing behind..[np]
[scl]you... ?!
[en2]
Huh? That guy behind
[nl2]you looks awfully
[nl3]familiar.
[en2]
I can't trade for
[nl2]something like that.
[nl3]Don't you have[np]
[scl]anything better?
[en2]
What? It won't open.
[nl2]This key must be
[nl3]wrong.
[en1]
[SP$00D3] .. someone..
[nl2]please help me!
[en1]
[F2]You got
[nl2]Napoleon's pot! If you
[nl3]look closely, it's[np]
[scl]full of holes.
[scl]Something's fishy
[scl]here...
[en1]
[F2]You got the
[nl2]shogun's pot! It ..
[nl3]looks like a normal[np]
[scl]pot. Is it a fake..?
[en1]
[F2]You got a chef's
[nl2]hat! It looks pretty
[nl3]new to have been used[np]
[scl]for 30 years... What
[scl]gives?
[en1]
[F2]You got a dog
[nl2]house! It looks like
[nl3]the only honest object[np]
[scl]in the shop.
[en1]
That's the best piece
[nl2]I have! It's an alien
[nl3]space monster shell[np]
[scl]from a famous sci-fi

[scl]item you'll trade for

[en2]
Hurry up and open it
[nl2]so we can go inside!
[en2]
[F2]Took back the bug

What is it? You want

[scl]plagiarized it. 
[scl]   - Cactus
[en2]
We are storing various
[nl2]documents for
[nl3]constructing the ant[np]
[scl]buster here. You can't
[scl]just barge in and read
[scl]everything!
[en2]
What? There's a power
[nl2]line down in the
[nl3]forest? The power[np]
[scl]switch is inside this

[scl]want to go in, you'll[np]
[scl]need permission from
[scl]soldier ュ[C$28]. Go get
[scl]his permission and[np]
[scl]then come back.
[en1]
There are lots of
[nl2]confusing books here
[nl3]so I can't figure it[np]
[scl]out, but maybe they
[scl]will mean something to
[scl]you.
[en2]
There are two levers.
[nl2]Which will you pull?
[en2]
Okay... maybe that did
[nl2]the trick?
[en1]

[nl2] Doh! It's pitch dark!
[en1]
There have been rumors
[nl2]that a ghost appears
[nl3]in the archives[np]
[scl]room... I hope I never
[scl]see it!
[en2]
It seems like the
[nl2]parasite is sucking
[nl3]nutrients from the[np]
[scl]tree. It looks like it
[scl]might come to life at
[scl]any moment and is[np]
[scl]really gross.
[en2]
It's a target with
[nl2]someone's face on it!
[en2]
It won't move, but
[nl2]it's hard and regular
[nl3]attacks won't hurt it![np]
[scl]Isn't there some kind
[scl]of attack we can do
[scl]from up close?
[en2]
I'd like to attack
[nl2]here, but if you get
[nl3]close, you'll get hit!
[en2]
It's a little hot.
[nl2]Isn't there a cooler
[nl3]song?
[en2]
Unless you can pull it
[nl2]with something... we
[nl3]can't do anything from[np]

This is the best for

How about it, when my

Hey kids, look at

If these pictures
[nl2]spread around, I'll

[en2]
Man, you really saved
[nl2]me! .. You don't
[nl3]remember me?
[en2]
It isn't like this is
[nl2]an uninhabited island,
[nl3]so I don't know why we[np]
[scl]have to live in a tent
[scl]out here...
[en2]
Thanks for all your
[nl2]help. I think I'll
[nl3]write down these[np]

[scl]If you see it, give it
[scl]a read. You boys... [np]
[scl]are nice kids!

You can have the

[scl]Your name is [team][np]

Fugugo fugo

[scl]my back. If you think
[scl]you can take it, give

If we anger the king

[en2]
How dare you!! You

[nl3]into my private[np]

[scl]my guards?! Get out of[np]
[scl]here this instant!!
[en2]
Please get out of
[nl2]here.. I'll lose my

[en2]
[F2]Doo dundundee
[nl2]dun! You got the
[nl3]king's 「striped[np]
[scl]underpants「 ...
[en1]
He must be hot wearing
[nl2]such a thick gown.
[en2]
It has blue and green
[nl2]stripes on it. It's
[nl3]pretty fancy.
[en2]
Start with green
[nl2]paint, then mix with
[nl3]red, and you'll get[np]
[scl]black! If you start
[scl]with red or something,
[scl]you won't get black.
[en2]
The first color you
[nl2]paint determines the
[nl3]pattern. Red is 「polka[np]
[scl]dots,「 blue is
[scl]「stripes,「 and green
[scl]is 「checkers.「 The[np]
[scl]reason... is a
[scl]mystery, even to me.

We finished the king's
[nl2]gown. Maybe Polly's
[nl3]father will change his[np]
[scl]attitude toward us
[scl]now.
[en2]
It goes allll the way
[nl2]to the top.
[en1]
I have to finish the
[nl2]king's portrait in
[nl3]time for his birthday[np]
[scl]3 days from now! But
[scl]all of the sudden, a
[scl]bunch of spiders from[np]
[scl]the forest mugged me
[scl]and stole my paints!
[scl]Oh, what can I do~.
[en2]
What are you doing? If
[nl2]you're acting
[nl3]suspicious, the[np]
[scl]soldiers will arrest
[scl]you again.
[en2]
The gown isn't
[nl2]finished yet.
[en2]
Wowzers! Those are the
[nl2]painting tools Caesar
[nl3]lost in the forest! Go[np]
[scl]take them to Caesar
[scl]right away.
[en2]
Those are the paints I
[nl2]lost in the forest...
[nl3]Thank you for finding[np]
[scl]them for me. But, I'll
[scl]let you keep them.
[scl]According to my[np]
[scl]calculations,
[scl]overlapping two of
[scl]those paints will[np]
[scl]finish this painting.
[scl]The problem is which
[scl]order to paint. My[np]
[scl]painting know-how is
[scl]in a book in the
[scl]castle archives.[np]
[scl]Someone who has seen
[scl]the king's gown should
[scl]be able to read the[np]
[scl]book and figure out
[scl]how to duplicate it.
[en2]
You can't paint like
[nl2]that. You have to
[nl3]focus and use all 3 at[np]
[scl]once.
[en2]
Unless you have all 3
[nl2]paints, we can't
[nl3]finish the painting.
[en2]
[SP$00D3]You want to paint it?
[nl2]Think of the king's
[nl3]gown and pick the[np]
[scl]first color:[np]
[scl]    Deon red
[scl]    Jack blue
[scl]    Max green[X$6E]
[en1]
Who is next?
[nl2]    Deon red
[nl3]    Jack blue[X$68]
[en1]
Who is next?
[nl2]    Deon red
[nl3]    Max green[X$68]
[en1]
Who is next?
[nl2]    Jack blue
[nl3]    Max green[X$68]
[en1]
Close, but the design
[nl2]is wrong. Go clear
[nl3]your head and try[np]
[scl]again later.
[en1]
It's.. pitch black!!
[nl2]Did you read my
[nl3]painting book? Go take[np]
[scl]a breather and try
[scl]again later.
[en1]
Don't forget to paint
[nl2]two layers.
[en2]
Stop it right there!
[nl2]Even if you paint on
[nl3]top of that, there's[np]
[scl]no way to fix it!
[scl]Leave and come back
[scl]later.
[en2]
[F2]It's beautiful~
[nl2]wonderful~ marvelous~
[nl3]That's the king's gown[np]
[scl]I remember!
[en1]
Good work. I'll go
[nl2]inform the king, so
[nl3]come along afterward.[np]
[scl]I'm sure the king will
[scl]be very pleased.
[en1]
You might even be
[nl2]better than me... but
[nl3]don't get some crazy[np]
[scl]idea and drop out of
[scl]school to be a
[scl]painter. There's no[np]
[scl]money in it, you know.
[en2]
I want to talk to that
[nl2]husky boy in the
[nl3]green...
[en2]
Buzz buzz
[nl2]TL: One of us is a
[nl3]huge scaredy bee.[np]
[scl]Which one could it be?
[en2]
Gum or candy... this
[nl2]smells like..
[nl3]gunpowder?! This is my[np]
[scl]favorite, Bomber Ball!
[en2]
Buzz buzz!
[nl2]TL: I almost dropped
[nl3]my honey pot! Please[np]
[scl]don't scare me like
[scl]that!
[en2]
A power line has
[nl2]fallen in the lake and
[nl3]it is electrified. It[np]
[scl]needs to be turned off
[scl]at the source to stop
[scl]it.
[en2]
[X$6A]Please.. I'm
[nl2]begging you.. go
[nl3]downstairs and turn[np]
[scl]the fans back on.. if
[scl]you don't, we'll all
[scl]die...
[en2]
[X$6A]Is the .. king
[nl2]alright..? If he's
[nl3]wearing his thick[np]
[scl]gown, it might already
[scl]be...
[en2]
[X$6A]I.. I can't
[nl2]move in his heat..
[nl3]It's probably cooler[np]
[scl]outside than inside...
[en2]
[X$6A]You kids look
[nl2]energetic even in this
[nl3]heat...
[en2]
[X$6A]W..wa..
[nl2]water...
[en2]
[X$6A]I thought I
[nl2]heard someone humming
[nl3]in the shower.. I must[np]
[scl]have gone insane from
[scl]this heat...
[en2]
[X$6A]Who was.. the
[nl2]idiot who turned
[nl3]off... the fans...

Mino minono
[nl2]TL: You want my
[nl3]beautiful coat, don't[np]
[scl]you? Well, sucks to be
[scl]you! I wouldn't let
[scl]you even touch it with[np]
[scl]your grubby little
[scl]hands.
[en2]
Minono mino~
[nl2]TL: But if my coat
[nl3]gets dirty, I'll burst[np]
[scl]into tears! I am a
[scl]girl, you know.
[en2]
Minono
[nl2]TL: You will learn the
[nl3]true terror of a[np]
[scl]woman's wrath!!
[en2]
Minono
[nl2]TL: Just take it away
[nl3]from me! I want it out[np]
[scl]of my sight!
[en1]
[F2]We got the
[nl2]「Forest Coat「! We
[nl3]can't understand that[np]
[scl]bug's sense of
[scl]fashion.
[en1]
Minono
[nl2]TL: Anything will do,
[nl3]so won't someone give[np]
[scl]me a new coat?
[en2]
Meep myuu
[nl2]TL: How do you like my
[nl3]new coat? It's all[np]
[scl]natural tree bark.
[en2]
Step aside. Weaklings
[nl2]may not pass. Step
[nl3]aside.
[en2]
This is the royal
[nl2]painter Caesar's house.
[nl3]Solomon is inside and[np]
[scl]they seem to be having
[scl]an argument.
[en2]
If anything happened
[nl2]to her, I could never
[nl3]face the departed[np]
[scl]queen. Please, hurry
[scl]and save the soldiers,
[scl]and rescue Princess[np]
[scl]Polly!
[en2]
Even with the Ant
[nl2]Buster, they came on
[nl3]us in swarms.. we[np]
[scl]never stood a chance.
[en2]
I hate to admit it,
[nl2]but our remaining
[nl3]forces are not[np]
[scl]sufficient to mount a
[scl]rescue for Princess
[scl]Polly.
[en2]
Oh no, I forgot to
[nl2]tell gramps that lunch
[nl3]was going to be[np]
[scl]tomatoes. Could you
[scl]tell him for me?
[en2]
I just couldn't live
[nl2]with myself if
[nl3]anything happened to[np]
[scl]Princess Polly.
[scl]Please, you must save
[scl]her!
[en2]
Dear Solomon,
[nl2]I've gone with Hassan
[nl3]to defeat the Blue[np]
[scl]Things. I forced
[scl]Hassan to keep this a
[scl]secret from you[np]
[scl]because you would have
[scl]come along, too, no
[scl]matter what I said. If[np]
[scl]anything happens to
[scl]us, please take care
[scl]of my father. He's[np]
[scl]hopeless on his own
[scl]because he gets lonely
[scl]easily. Also, make[np]
[scl]sure those 3 boys can
[scl]safely leave our
[scl]kingdom. But don't[np]
[scl]worry, I'll take care
[scl]of those Blue Things
[scl]and restore peace to[np]
[scl]our kingdom.
[scl]    -Polly
[en2]
Huh? This face....
[nl2]It's Max! It looks
[nl3]just like Max!!
[en2]
Want to buy some
[nl2]caramel? I've run out
[nl3]of the free bonus,[np]
[scl]though.
[en2]
What? You don't know
[nl2]about Great Mecha? You
[nl3]guys are so lame. He's[np]
[scl]ュ3, but there's a ュ1
[scl]and ュ2. I used to have
[scl]those, too, but[np]
[scl]someone stole them
[scl]from me. But since I
[scl]have ュ3 now, I don't[np]
[scl]mind. Pow pow! Bang!
[scl]Bang!!
[en2]
It's a toy robot. It
[nl2]winds up in the back.
[en2]
Look at what you did!
[nl2]You've ruined it!
[nl3]You'd better pay for[np]
[scl]this, you know!! 
[scl]Just kidding, that
[scl]part falls off all the[np]
[scl]time. It's easy to
[scl]fix.
[en1]
Isn't there anyone
[nl2]who's on my level?
[en2]
Keep this a secret
[nl2]from Jim.. come over
[nl3]here.
[en2]
We were doing a PK
[nl2]match, but the teacher
[nl3]embarrassed him and[np]
[scl]he's really angry. I
[scl]don't know what he'll
[scl]do to us.
[en2]
Look carefully at
[nl2]Jim's movement, equip
[nl3]the soccer shoes, and[np]
[scl]hit [C$04] to kick it in!
[en1]
You guys are a
[nl2]disgrace, taking a
[nl3]man's challenge and[np]
[scl]then running away.
[scl][team] Team is a bunch
[scl]of cowards, huh?
[en2]
Come on, nerds! You
[nl2]need to concentrate if
[nl3]you want to defeat my[np]
[scl]iron guard.
[en2]
Don't spread this
[nl2]around, but Jim is
[nl3]really reckless, so a[np]
[scl]feint can beat him.
[en2]
Using [C$0A] to change
[nl2]your leader and trick
[nl3]Jim with a feint is[np]
[scl]one way to beat him!
[en2]
...That.. cannot..
[nl2]be----
[en1]
Move. Me. To find.
[nl2]Invisible. Floor.
[en2]

[nl2]        [C$42][X$7E]
[en1]

[nl2] Th.. the floo----
[en1]
You. Moron. Be. More.
[nl2]Careful!
[en1]

[nl2] Hurry up and get it.
[en2]
[F2]Jim gave the
[nl2]fishing hook back! It
[nl3]has a feather for[np]
[scl]bait. But you can't
[scl]use a hook by itself.
[en1]
Haha, that was fun.
[nl2]Come and play again.
[nl3]I'll treat you right.[np]
[scl]Hey, you guys, get in
[scl]the tent!
[en1]
It is safe up to here.
[nl2]Let's continue.
[en1]
Duty. complete.
[nl2]goodbye.
[en1]
I tried to get the
[nl2]hook back, but Jim
[nl3]challenged me to a PK[np]
[scl]shootout. When I lost,
[scl]he threw my shoes into
[scl]the lake!
[en2]
Miss Gina told us to
[nl2]get some fish from the
[nl3]lake.. Leader! What do[np]
[scl]we do!?
[en2]
We were supposed to be
[nl2]in charge of fishing,
[nl3]but goalkeeper Jim[np]
[scl]took our hook and
[scl]won't give it back!
[scl]Even though he's[np]
[scl]supposed to be helping
[scl]us! Man, if we can't
[scl]get some fish, Dorothy[np]
[scl]will hate us. I'm
[scl]pretty weak against
[scl]forceful women... err,[np]
[scl]what was I saying?
[scl]ンsiighン
[en2]
Okay, if we combine
[nl2]that with this rod..
[nl3]alright! A fishing[np]
[scl]rod. You can have it.
[en1]
[F2]The fishing hook
[nl2]became a fishing rod.
[nl3]Equip it and press [C$04][np]
[scl]to use it. 
[scl]Hey, aren't you guys
[scl]on fishing duty? [np]
[scl]Hehehe.. actually,
[scl]I've never fished
[scl]before in my life.[np]
[scl]Sorry, but could you
[scl]get some fish for us?
[scl]Press START and equip[np]
[scl]the fishing rod, then
[scl]press [C$04] to use it.
[scl]Got it?
[en1]
To pull in a fish, you
[nl2]can't just hold the
[nl3]button down. You have[np]
[scl]to gently apply the
[scl][C$08], okay?
[en2]
When you cast the rod,
[nl2]you need to hold [C$04]
[nl3]or it will come right[np]
[scl]back. Be careful!
[en2]
Hurry up with our
[nl2]fish! Actually, this
[nl3]boulder we're sitting[np]
[scl]on is pretty fishy.
[en2]
Oooh aah!
[nl2]TL: Save them! Bad men
[nl3]locked them in! Work[np]
[scl]together to move it!
[scl]Please!
[en2]
If we work together,
[nl2]we might be able to
[nl3]move it.
[en2]
I see! If we switch
[nl2]the tiles here, we can
[nl3]complete the picture.
[en2]
Probably the left and
[nl2]right are the same
[nl3]picture, just[np]
[scl]mirrored.
[en2]
What? There's
[nl2]something under the
[nl3]board.
[en1]

[nl2] Boom!
[en1]
Ooh ooh ooh!
[nl2]TL: Hide! Go to the
[nl3]tree's shadow! They're[np]
[scl]coming! The bad men
[scl]are coming!
[en2]
Ooh!
[nl2]TL: Follow me!
[en1]
[X$6A]Let's steer
[nl2]clear of this psycho!
[en2]
Hurry, tell me which
[nl2]pot it landed in.
[en1]
Ooh ooh
[nl2]TL: Use keys from
[nl3][C$4A] to open[np]
[scl]matching chests on the
[scl]ship. Bye-bye!
[en1]
It won't work. The key
[nl2]doesn't fit.
[en2]
There's a keyhole
[nl2]here.
[en2]
Some numbers came
[nl2]out... Black 2, White
[nl3]3, and one more Black[np]
[scl]1... What could it
[scl]mean?
[en1]
Go for ride?
[nl2]    Okay
[nl3]    Nah[X$68]
[en1]

[nl2] What is it?
[en2]

[nl2] How strange.
[en2]
Whoa! A huge cave
[nl2]opened up.
[en1]
[X$6A]He's not
[nl2]moving.. is he dead?!
[en1]

[nl2] [X$6A]Hey, wait!!
[en1]
Snap out of it, man!
[nl2]If he drinks this,
[nl3]he'll be fine. This[np]
[scl]drug only works on
[scl]soldiers, but it will
[scl]revive them, even if[np]
[scl]they are severely
[scl]wounded. Drink this
[scl]「Soldier Blue「!
[en1]
Oh! I'm alive! I hate
[nl2]to say it, but Polly
[nl3]fell into enemy hands.[np]
[scl]Hurry back to the
[scl]castle to prepare for
[scl]our next offensive.
[en1]
Thank you. They caught
[nl2]me by surprise. I need
[nl3]to go back now.
[en1]
There are still
[nl2]injured soldiers
[nl3]ahead! Let's keep[np]
[scl]going.
[en1]
Take this! and that! I
[nl2]can handle this guy on
[nl3]my own!
[en1]

[nl2] [X$6A]Geh!
[en1]
[X$6A]The medicine
[nl2]fell down the hole.
[nl3]There's no one else[np]
[scl]who can help the hurt
[scl]soldiers. You are
[scl]their only hope. I can[np]
[scl]get back to the castle
[scl]on my own, but please
[scl]help the others...
[en2]

[nl2] .. What should I do!?
[en2]
I'm in your debt.
[nl2]Princess Polly is..?!
[nl3]I'll leave it to you[np]
[scl]kids.
[en1]
The dirt seems softer
[nl2]here.. hmm.. maybe we
[nl3]can dig a hole with[np]
[scl]「that「?
[en2]
..It's too hard to dig
[nl2]here.
[en1]

[nl2] Hm? Waaaaah!
[en1]
Huh? Nothing is
[nl2]written here.
[en2]
I can't even find the
[nl2]keyhole. How are we
[nl3]supposed to open[np]
[scl]this...?
[en2]
It looks sort of like
[nl2]a fish and sort of
[nl3]like a lever. I wonder[np]
[scl]if we can pull it with
[scl]something.
[en2]
I wonder if this will
[nl2]move.
[en2]
Black 2, white 3, and
[nl2]then black 1. What
[nl3]could it mean?
[en2]

[nl2]               [X$7B]
[en2]
I will follow my
[nl2]master's orders as
[nl3]long as I have energy[np]
[scl]in my circuits.
[en2]

[nl2] Then get outta here.
[en2]
Start with [C$02]. Dodge
[nl2]with [C$08].
[en1]
[SP$033F]Gah! How did you
[nl2]figure it out! Fine,
[nl3]a promise is a prom..[np]
[scl]Dude, we're pirates!
[scl]We're not letting you
[scl]out! But maybe if you[np]
[scl]give us the treasure..
[scl]    Okay, here you go.
[scl]    Not a chance![X$68]
[en1]
Then you can rot in
[nl2]there!
[en1]

[nl2] I'll remember this!!
[en1]

[nl2] Ooh ooh aah! Ooh ooh!
[en1]

[nl2] .. Run... run... run.
[en2]
Ooh ooh aah!
[nl2]TL: Don't fall for
[nl3]their lies. Always[np]
[scl]stay with your
[scl]friends! Bye-bye!
[en1]
You have one more
[nl2]chance. Use it wisely.
[nl3]Select [C$46] from[np]
[scl]the side menu.
[en2]
If I give you all my
[nl2]honey, I'll be out of
[nl3]a job! You won't get[np]
[scl]any more from me.
[en2]
Princess, the Ant
[nl2]Buster was invented to
[nl3]repel the Blue Things.[np]
[scl]I haven't done tests
[scl]to see if it will kill
[scl]them.
[en1]
Hassan, what are you
[nl2]saying?! I don't want
[nl3]to just sit here and[np]
[scl]wait to die! If we
[scl]don't act fast,
[scl]they'll come again[np]
[scl]tonight and destroy
[scl]our kingdom. Hurry up
[scl]and give me that[np]
[scl]Buster Cannon!
[en1]
I understand. If
[nl2]you've made up your
[nl3]mind, I won't try to[np]
[scl]stop you. I'll watch
[scl]over the castle while
[scl]you're gone and[np]
[scl]entrust you to Hassan.
[en1]
Good answer! Alright,
[nl2]all [C$24] of you need to
[nl3]gather around and[np]
[scl]position yourselves
[scl]like us. Then, push
[scl][C$02] on the [C$48] on[np]
[scl]the side. Okay,
[scl]everyone get back,
[scl]let's see [team][np]
[scl]Team's [C$48]!
[en1]
What are you saying?
[nl2]You're coming with me!
[en1]
We can't lift this
[nl2]heavy pot.
[en2]
If we each get on a
[nl2]different side and the
[nl3][C$24] of us work[np]
[scl]together, we should be
[scl]able to lift it.
[en2]
When it's too big a
[nl2]job for one person,
[nl3]gather around and use[np]
[scl][C$48]!
[en2]
Some items are used
[nl2]from the [C$4A] menu, 
[nl3]and some are[np]
[scl]equipped from the menu
[scl]and used with [C$04]. Did
[scl]you know that?
[en2]
You can find out lots
[nl2]of things by using [C$46]!
[en2]
You can't just yank on
[nl2]it, boy! Press the
[nl3][C$08] gently after a[np]
[scl]fish bites. Nice and
[scl]easy.
[en2]
Say something to that
[nl2]egghead sitting over
[nl3]there! Just because[np]
[scl]Miss Gina made him
[scl]leader, he thinks he's
[scl]the king of the world.
[en2]
That egghead has been
[nl2]saying he's in charge
[nl3]while Miss Gina is[np]
[scl]gone. What a prick.
[en2]
How do you move it
[nl2]again?
[en2]
Jim is still missing..
[nl2]I hope Miss Gina comes
[nl3]back soon. Who even[np]
[scl]cares about Jim?!
[en1]
Dear stinky brats,
[nl2]You guys suck.
[nl3]Don't think you'll get[np]
[scl]away with lifting my
[scl]treasure. So, I'm
[scl]keeping an eye on your[np]
[scl]smokin' hot teacher.
[scl]If you ever want to
[scl]see her again, come to[np]
[scl]the valley past the
[scl]lake.
[scl] Don't forget my[np]
[scl]crystal ball!
[scl] -The Greatest Pirate
[scl]Under the Sky, King[np]

[en2]
B.. But... Oh,
[nl2]Princess! Wait! Don't
[nl3]forget this super[np]
[scl]「Buster Cannon「!
[en1]
It seems like
[nl2]something wild was
[nl3]going on back there.[np]
[scl]What could it have
[scl]been?
[en2]
It's probably a lift
[nl2]leading to the other
[nl3]side.
[en2]
S.. someone! Miss Gina
[nl2]was.. taken by
[nl3]pirates!! What do we[np]
[scl]do, [team] Team?!
[en1]
It's no use, he can't
[nl2]hear us. Let's get
[nl3]closer.
[en2]
Miss Gina is in
[nl2]trouble!! ... What?
[nl3]You already know?[np]
[scl]They're holding her
[scl]hostage? They may be
[scl]tiny, but they seem[np]
[scl]serious. It looks like
[scl]they busted the gate
[scl]and headed to the[np]
[scl]valley.
[scl]What are you waiting
[scl]for? Hurry up and[np]
[scl]untie me!
[en1]
Without a key, it
[nl2]looks impossible to
[nl3]remove...
[en2]
Found a key!!
[en2]
Squeak squeak!
[nl2]TL: If you yank it
[nl3]that fast it doesn't[np]
[scl]hurt~!
[en2]
The fat boy seems to
[nl2]be holding the tall
[nl3]one and the little[np]
[scl]one. There were
[scl]pirates like us way
[scl]back then?!
[en2]
Energy Gear... 
[nl2]R... regret!!
[en2]
Nope, it's way too
[nl2]tall to reach!
[en2]
Teamwork takes all 3
[nl2]of us!
[en2]
If we work together,
[nl2]we can even reach high
[nl3]places!
[en1]
So.. so heavy!
[nl2]Max! Let's think this
[nl3]through before you[np]
[scl]squish someone.
[en1]
If we work together...
[nl2]haha! We did it!
[en1]
Wow! A treasure chest
[nl2]came out!
[en1]
Come on! You can't
[nl2]remove them from over
[nl3]there!
[en2]
T..Thank you so much,
[nl2][team] Team! I'm sorry
[nl3]I've been such a jerk.[np]
[scl]From now on, I swear
[scl]to turn over a new
[scl]leaf...[np]
[scl]   Not!
[en1]
[team] Team, come
[nl2]closer.
[en2]
You are a
[nl2]「very marvelous「 team
[nl3]      The End!
[en1]
You did have the
[nl2]crystal ball! That
[nl3]will lead us straight[np]
[scl]to 「Maverick's
[scl]Treasure.「 Now, it
[scl]will finally be mine![np]
[scl]Patchies, place the
[scl]ball over there.
[en1]
Just wait, a treasure
[nl2]will come out now.
[en1]
Even if you jump, it's
[nl2]too far... If only
[nl3]this box weren't here.
[en2]

[nl2] Forgive me, Patchies..
[en2]
After they put the
[nl2]ball there, it started
[nl3]glowing, and the[np]
[scl]door... Miss Gina!
[scl]What happened to her!?
[en2]
Isn't there a switch
[nl2]nearby?
[en2]
Some little kid
[nl2]showing off cuz he's
[nl3]taller than I am! I[np]
[scl]won't let you go any
[scl]further!
[en2]
Leave us the ball and
[nl2]get out of here! With
[nl3]that treasure, we can[np]
[scl]live out our lives in
[scl]luxury.
[en2]
You stole the crystal
[nl2]balls we were looking
[nl3]for, you took the keys[np]
[scl]we wanted, seriously,
[scl]you guys are worse
[scl]than pirates!
[en2]
Your teacher is quite
[nl2]a foxy lady. Our
[nl3]leader is ugly as sin.[np]
[scl]We're a little jealous
[scl]of you guys.
[en2]
We'll get run over if
[nl2]we get too close...
[nl3]what should we do?
[en2]
The door is actually
[nl2]not very strong. That
[nl3]means...
[en2]
Man, smashing up
[nl2]against this over and
[nl3]over is really[np]
[scl]starting to smart.
[en2]
You can't lift it
[nl2]alone...
[en2]
There seems to be a
[nl2]trick to making it
[nl3]work.
[en2]
Let's get some speed
[nl2]and BOOM! smash it!
[en1]
What does it say?
[nl2]「Sorry nerds, you'll
[nl3]be stuck here until[np]
[scl]you die!「
[scl]Wow, what a jerk!
[en2]
It says 「Sisko's
[nl2]House.「 But the door
[nl3]is locked...
[en2]
No one seems to be
[nl2]home.
[en2]
Let's hurry up and get
[nl2]the crystal ball and
[nl3]get out of here!
[en2]
Kweh kweh!
[nl2]TL: .. These guys seem
[nl3]suspicious!
[en2]
Let's get close and
[nl2]push it.
[en2]
Fugo fugo!
[nl2]TL: Come here!
[en2]
What are you doing?!
[nl2]The dungeon door has
[nl3]been left open!
[en2]

[nl3]  次は,おヨメさん・・・見つけなきゃね.
[en2]
Who is this wrinkly
[nl2]grandma?!?!
[en2]
Is this reality!? If
[nl2]it's a dream, wake me
[nl3]up now!
[en2]
You guys are a 「sort
[nl2]of marvelous「 team.
[nl3]The End!
[en1]
You guys are a 「barely
[nl2]marvelous「 team. The
[nl3]End!
[en1]
It looks like
[nl2]something big was set
[nl3]here.
[en2]
You guys are an
[nl2]「almost marvelous「
[nl3]team. The End!
[en1]
You guys are a 「not
[nl2]quite marvelous「 team.
[nl3]The End!
[en1]
You guys are a 「should
[nl2]have tried a little
[nl3]harder「 team. The End!
[en1]
You guys are a 「really
[nl2]need some work「 team.
[nl3]The End!
[en1]
You guys are a 「sort
[nl2]of disappointing「
[nl3]team. The End!
[en1]
You guys are a 「very
[nl2]disappointing「 team.
[nl3]The End!
[en1]
But what a terrible
[nl2]story...
[en2]
Feelin' lucky? Just
[nl2]try to get past!
[en2]
This is just a
[nl2]feeling, but aren't
[nl3]some of the soldiers[np]
[scl]from the castle
[scl]missing?
[en2]
Hassan took the
[nl2]finished Ant Buster
[nl3]and left. He said he[np]
[scl]had to make it
[scl]stronger somehow... I
[scl]think he went to[np]
[scl]Princess Polly's room.
[en2]
The bandits made the
[nl2]town become like this!
[en2]
He seemed like a good
[nl2]person, but he was
[nl3]actually the bandit[np]
[scl]leader...
[en2]
[F2]You received a
[nl2]dog bone! What a
[nl3]peculiar sheriff.
[en1]
We thought there was
[nl2]treasure in here so we
[nl3]came in, but then the[np]
[scl]door closed and we
[scl]were trapped! So what,
[scl]you still haven't[np]
[scl]found the treasure? I
[scl]don't want to get hit
[scl]by any more lightning,[np]
[scl]so later gators!
[en1]
If you have something
[nl2]to say, come here and
[nl3]say it!
[en2]
The dog guarding the
[nl2]entrance to 「Death
[nl3]Lake「 is my pet. The[np]
[scl]only time he is
[scl]friendly is when he's
[scl]eating, and once he[np]
[scl]finishes eating, he
[scl]falls asleep on the
[scl]spot!
[en2]
[F2]Received another
[nl2]bone!
[en1]
「Death Lake「 is
[nl2]dangerous, so be
[nl3]careful.
[en2]
Please hurry and find
[nl2]Indio's daughter in
[nl3]「Death Lake「 and save[np]
[scl]my boy!
[en2]
There's a lot of stuff
[nl2]in this room, so you
[nl3]should take a good[np]
[scl]look around.
[en2]
No two ways about it,
[nl2]this is a pirate!
[en2]
My late husband was
[nl2]the spitting image of
[nl3]grandpa here. The[np]
[scl]pirate blood runs
[scl]thick.
[en2]
Who is this pretty
[nl2]lady with that tough-
[nl3]looking kid?
[en2]
Oh, stop it, it's me
[nl2]of course! When I was
[nl3]younger. You haven't[np]
[scl]changed at all.
[en2]
He's my only son,
[nl2]Blue. Years ago he
[nl3]said he wanted to[np]
[scl]become a pirate like
[scl]his father and left
[scl]this town. I wonder[np]
[scl]what he's doing now. I
[scl]hope he hasn't been
[scl]killed on some far[np]
[scl]away island...
[en2]
We have to take this
[nl2]child home right away.
[nl3]I'm sure his mother is[np]
[scl]worried.
[en1]
The people in town are
[nl2]all liars! Miss Sisko
[nl3]isn't a bad person at[np]
[scl]all! You've gotta
[scl]believe me! You guys
[scl]try talking to her,[np]
[scl]too. I'm sure you will
[scl]be able to see she
[scl]isn't bad.
[en1]
The crow in the
[nl2]cemetery is guarding
[nl3]my father's grave. If[np]
[scl]he sees these flowers,
[scl]I'm sure he'll
[scl]remember me.
[en2]
Will you listen to
[nl2]what I have to say?
[en2]
I should be the one to
[nl2]do it, but when I
[nl3]think of the[np]
[scl]townspeople, I can't
[scl]go outside...
[en2]
It's so sad.. the
[nl2]child is in shock and
[nl3]can't say the truth.
[en2]
Miss Sisko is a nice
[nl2]person, see?
[en2]
You guys really saved
[nl2]the day.
[en2]
[X$6A]As long as this
[nl2]crow is here, we can't
[nl3]get near the[np]
[scl]tombstone.
[en2]
It's a tombstone for
[nl2]Christopher Benson.
[en2]
There's a gap in the
[nl2]stone here... I think
[nl3]something's inside...
[en2]
From here you can't
[nl2]tell what it is.
[en2]
Caw caw!
[nl2]TL: Sisko's flower!Caw
[nl3]caw![np]
[scl]TL: Indio's daughter
[scl]isn't bad! She's a
[scl]nice, pretty girl!
[en2]
There's a mansion in
[nl2]the East. An old lady
[nl3]is living next door,[np]
[scl]so it's easy to find.
[en2]
For bandits to steal a
[nl2]「treasure「 from
[nl3]pirates, it's like a[np]
[scl]bad joke...
[en2]
How can this be the
[nl2]only water left in
[nl3]town!? If I could go[np]
[scl]back.. I wish I'd dug
[scl]more wells...
[en2]
Really, I should thank
[nl2]you for taking that
[nl3]junk off my hands...
[en2]
Grr ruff ruff!
[nl2]TL: This way leads to
[nl3]「Death Lake,「 a very[np]
[scl]dangerous place, so I
[scl]won't let you pass!
[en2]
Zzzzzz....
[nl2]TL: Zzzzzzz....
[en2]

[nl2] What a spoiled dog.
[en2]
Where did you get this
[nl2]picture? Everyone in
[nl3]this town should[np]
[scl]recognize these guys.
[en2]
It's the legendary
[nl2]pirate Christopher
[nl3]Benson, isn't it? He[np]
[scl]tried to take back the
[scl]「town's treasure「 and
[scl]died doing it. He's in[np]
[scl]the cemetery outside
[scl]of town.
[en2]
Indio was leading the
[nl2]bandits!! It's his
[nl3]fault they attacked[np]
[scl]us, our water dried
[scl]up, and nothing will
[scl]go our way.
[en2]
We called this the
[nl2]「town's treasure.「
[nl3]According to legendary[np]
[scl]pirate Christopher
[scl]Benson, it was a piece
[scl]of the puzzle to find[np]
[scl]Maverick's treasure on
[scl]another island.
[en2]
I know the guys in
[nl2]this picture all too
[nl3]well.
[en2]
It's Benson, yeah? He
[nl2]was a good guy but got
[nl3]taken in when Indio[np]
[scl]said he could make a
[scl]time machine. He let
[scl]Indio borrow the[np]
[scl]「town's treasure「 and
[scl]got taken advantage
[scl]of.
[en2]
This is Indio, the
[nl2]leader of the bandits,
[nl3]right? He tricked[np]
[scl]Benson with promises
[scl]of a 「time machine「
[scl]and stole the 「town's[np]
[scl]treasure.「
[en2]
Now that Indio is
[nl2]dead, no one knows
[nl3]where the crystal ball[np]
[scl]is. If you want to
[scl]know so badly, make
[scl]yourself a time[np]
[scl]machine!
[en2]
I sort of recognize
[nl2]these people, but
[nl3]maybe not...
[en2]
Didn't this guy say 「I
[nl2]can travel through
[nl3]time「 or something[np]
[scl]crazy like that...?
[en2]
A long time ago, Indio
[nl2]said he could use the
[nl3]「town's treasure「 to[np]
[scl]travel through time...
[scl]or did he?
[en2]
This crystal was the
[nl2]「town's treasure「 to
[nl3]us, but to Indio it[np]
[scl]was a piece of a time
[scl]machine.
[en2]
Wow, take a look at
[nl2]this picture!
[en2]
It's the legendary
[nl2]pirate Benson, isn't
[nl3]it?
[en2]
This guy is Indio, the
[nl2]guy who fooled the
[nl3]legendary pirate[np]
[scl]Benson, isn't it? He
[scl]filled Benson's head
[scl]with lies but got[np]
[scl]caught trying to make
[scl]his escape.
[en2]
If you can find 4 of
[nl2]these crystal balls,
[nl3]it's rumored they'll[np]
[scl]unlock a marvelous
[scl]treasure... Benson
[scl]found this one and we[np]
[scl]kept it as the 「town's
[scl]treasure.「
[en2]
This is quite an old
[nl2]photograph...
[en2]
This guy's wife is
[nl2]living next to the
[nl3]giant house in the[np]
[scl]East.
[en2]
This guy is the father
[nl2]of the girl who lives
[nl3]in 「Death Lake.「
[en2]
Only Indio knew where
[nl2]to find the 「town's
[nl3]treasure「 and he's[np]
[scl]dead now.
[en2]
What is this
[nl2]photograph?!
[en2]

[nl2] Oh my, what a hunk.
[en2]
Ohoho, this is another
[nl2]fine man. Who could it
[nl3]be?
[en2]

[nl2] What a pretty jewel.
[en2]
That's an old
[nl2]picture...
[en2]

[nl2] I don't know...
[en2]
I don't know who it
[nl2]is... but the eyes
[nl3]look like Miss[np]
[scl]Sisko's!
[en2]

[nl2] No idea...
[en2]
This picture was very
[nl2]special to my father.
[en2]
My father told me he
[nl2]made a time machine to
[nl3]make this man believe[np]
[scl]that the water would
[scl]dry up in this town.
[en2]
It's my father, Indio.
[nl2]He said he could
[nl3]travel through time.
[en2]
The people of this
[nl2]town believe this is a
[nl3]special item that will[np]
[scl]lead to a treasure,
[scl]but to us, it's
[scl]nothing more than a[np]
[scl]component of the 「time
[scl]machine.「
[en2]
Oh wow, what are you
[nl2]doing with that photo?
[en2]
This is my husband
[nl2]when he was younger.
[nl3]His name was[np]
[scl]Christopher Benson. He
[scl]said wild things like,
[scl]「I found someone who[np]
[scl]can build a time
[scl]machine「 and was
[scl]deceived.
[en2]
When I met him, he
[nl2]didn't really seem the
[nl3]type to steal things.
[en2]
My husband found this
[nl2]crystal ball that is
[nl3]supposed to lead to a[np]
[scl]greater treasure. My
[scl]son left home in
[scl]search of this crystal[np]
[scl]ball.
[en2]
[SP$0121]Where did
[nl2]you find this photo?!
[nl3]Have you showed it to[np]
[scl]anyone else? Keep this
[scl]a secret, but listen
[scl]to me: Indio really[np]
[scl]did make a time
[scl]machine. The 「Time
[scl]Room「 he used is in[np]
[scl]the locked up mansion.
[scl]I don't know how he
[scl]did it, but this is a[np]
[scl]message Indio left
[scl]behind.
[en1]
The old lady over
[nl2]there should have the
[nl3]key to the mansion.
[en2]
Dangit, how could all
[nl2]the water dry up! I
[nl3]should have listened[np]
[scl]to Indio and dug more
[scl]wells...
[en2]
[SP$0121]There are 3
[nl2]clocks.. The first one
[nl3]is at 10:00, the next[np]
[scl]at 9:30, and the last
[scl]at 10:30...
[en2]
I'll lend you the key,
[nl2]so come over here.
[en2]
Now you can enter the
[nl2]mansion.
[en1]
[F2]Received the
[nl2]mansion key! Now you
[nl3]can enter the 「time[np]
[scl]room「!
[en1]
Even now when I look
[nl2]at that mansion, I
[nl3]still feel my[np]
[scl]husband's presence, so
[scl]I can't go in...
[en2]
..Farewell.. and thank
[nl2]you!
[en1]

[nl2] You sure about that?
[en2]
You're really sure
[nl2]about that?
[en2]
The oldest is left of
[nl2]the youngest, the
[nl3]youngest is right of[np]
[scl]the middle one, the
[scl]middle one is left of
[scl]the youngest. If you[np]
[scl]figure it out, start
[scl]from the oldest and
[scl]point at us in order!
[en2]
[SP$020D]Not even
[nl2]close! Is that your
[nl3]best shot? The oldest[np]
[scl]is left of the
[scl]youngest, the youngest
[scl]is right of the middle[np]
[scl]one, the middle one is
[scl]left of the youngest.
[scl]If you figure it out,[np]
[scl]start from the oldest
[scl]and point at us in
[scl]order.
[en1]
The guard in front of
[nl2]Princess Polly's room
[nl3]is gone. I wonder what[np]
[scl]happened. Now anyone
[scl]can come and go as
[scl]they like.
[en2]
I wonder what will be
[nl2]made in this pot. I
[nl3]can't wait to find[np]
[scl]out!
[en2]
Is lunch ready yet?
[nl2]What is Dorothy
[nl3]planning on making,[np]
[scl]anyway?
[en2]
The king's hobby is
[nl2]gardening. Supposedly
[nl3]there is a magnificent[np]
[scl]garden behind the
[scl]castle... but I've
[scl]never actually seen[np]
[scl]it.
[en2]
It doesn't seem too
[nl2]heavy.
[en2]
I never thought I'd
[nl2]see you all again. I'm
[nl3]so glad I was wrong.[np]
[scl]You must have had a
[scl]hard time coming all
[scl]the way here. Mr.[np]
[scl]Arnold? I see, Mr.
[scl]Arnold came to help
[scl]out. That's good.[np]
[scl]Let's get out of here.
[scl]According to what the
[scl]Patchies said, the[np]
[scl]only way out is to use
[scl]the elevator behind
[scl]the blue door. I found[np]
[scl]a blue box in here...
[scl]I bet the key to the
[scl]elevator door is[np]
[scl]inside. But no matter
[scl]what I did, I couldn't
[scl]open it. Can you boys[np]
[scl]do something?
[en1]
I wonder what's for
[nl2]lunch~
[en2]
What? Lunch is another
[nl2]tomato dish!? You came
[nl3]all the way just to[np]
[scl]tell me that? Well,
[scl]aren't you nice boys.
[en2]
You guys are pretty
[nl2]nice.
[en2]
Bzzt! Wrong item,
[nl2]Deon!
[en2]
Come on, Deon, you
[nl2]know better than that.
[en2]
Using that item makes
[nl2]no sense, Jack.
[en2]
Did you open the 3
[nl2]types of treasure
[nl3]chest in the ship? The[np]
[scl]place to use the key
[scl]is west of the ship.
[en1]

[scl]    いいよ,別に[X$68]
[en1]
I'll tell you the
[nl2]correct way to rotate
[nl3]it.. right [C$22] times,[np]
[scl]left [C$28] times, and
[scl]right [C$26] times. I'm
[scl]pretty sure that was[np]
[scl]it.
[en1]
Did you find a lever
[nl2]in the cave shaped
[nl3]like a fish? Speaking[np]
[scl]of fish... now you get
[scl]it, right?
[en1]
It's almost lunch
[nl2]time, so let's head
[nl3]back!
[en1]
Jim is in trouble
[nl2]across the river! We
[nl3]need the key that the[np]
[scl]fish ate. Look closely
[scl]to see which fish ate
[scl]it!
[en1]
Try using your 「mitt
[nl2]and ball「 on things in
[nl3]your way!
[en1]
Are you stuck with the
[nl2]pipe? Did you know a
[nl3]short enough kid can[np]
[scl]fit inside?
[en1]
Is there a better way?
[nl2]If you think of one,
[nl3]tell me, okay?
[en2]
We have to get this
[nl2]child home.. I'm sure
[nl3]his mother is worried.
[en2]
Thank you, my father
[nl2]loved this flower. If
[nl3]you show it to the[np]
[scl]crow, I'm sure he'll
[scl]remember me.
[en1]
I was an idiot for
[nl2]asking [team] Team.
[nl3]From now on, I'm[np]
[scl]calling you Sissy
[scl]Team.
[en2]
Soccer is getting
[nl2]boring.
[en2]
Let's do it again
[nl2]sometime.
[en2]
Don't let Jim know we
[nl2]told you, but... he
[nl3]has a crush on Miss[np]
[scl]Gina!
[en2]
If you just had some
[nl2]「soccer shoes「 you
[nl3]could kick this ball[np]
[scl]like a champ...
[en2]
Why is this mansion
[nl2]the only locked

[en2]
[F2]The door opened!
[nl2]Where could the 「time
[nl3]room「 be?
[en2]
I should still
[nl2]remember a little
[nl3]about the town's[np]
[scl]history.
[en2]
Caw caw!
[nl2]TL: You guys are
[nl3]alright.
[en2]
My dog falls straight
[nl2]asleep after eating,
[nl3]so don't worry.
[en1]
This is my
[nl2]grandfather.
[en1]

[nl2] This is...
[en1]
Instead of a ghost, I
[nl2]wish a sprout would
[nl3]come out...
[en2]
A ghost wouldn't come
[nl2]out in the daytime~
[en2]

[nl2] A.. a shadow!
[en2]
I wonder if he's
[nl2]really here?
[en2]
Even if he's a ghost,
[nl2]he's awfully shy...
[en2]
I've always been bad
[nl2]with ghosts and
[nl3]frogs....
[en2]
Indio's daughter must
[nl2]be behind this!
[en2]
It's a little scary,
[nl2]but exciting, too!
[en2]
Shall we give him a
[nl2]shake?
[en2]
It's not that I don't
[nl2]trust you, but I
[nl3]promised someone I[np]
[scl]wouldn't tell anyone
[scl]my name or where I
[scl]came from.
[en2]
What's that picture?
[nl2]It's too far for me to
[nl3]see it well.
[en2]
Hey, it's me and
[nl2]Indio! I don't
[nl3]remember taking this[np]
[scl]photograph... just who
[scl]are you kids?
[en1]
What in tarnation!?
[nl2]The 「Blue Crystal「 was
[nl3]stolen by bandits?![np]
[scl]How do you know?! If
[scl]that's true, we're in
[scl]serious trouble! I[np]
[scl]know where the hideout
[scl]of the 「Mammoth
[scl]Brothers「 is, so let's[np]
[scl]go save Indio! I'll
[scl]take that picture if
[scl]you don't mind.
[en2]

[nl2] Let's hurry!
[en2]

[nl2] Watch this!
[en1]
We should be able to
[nl2]enter through here.
[nl3]Hurry!
[en1]

[nl2] Come over here.
[en2]
Maybe if we search
[nl2]somewhere else I'll
[nl3]remember.
[en1]
Won't you try sailing
[nl2]the seven seas as a
[nl3]pirate?
[en2]
What kind of joke is
[nl2]it for bandits to
[nl3]attack pirates?
[en2]
Why don't you see for
[nl2]yourself?
[en2]
Blue, behave yourself!
[en2]
My mommy is pretty,
[nl2]isn't she?
[en2]
When I get older, I
[nl2]want to be a teacher!
[en2]
What kind of bird egg
[nl2]is this..? What?!
[en1]
[F2]A baby crow
[nl2]hatched.
[en2]
Wow! Cool!
[en1]
I wonder how to make
[nl2]the flower open up...
[en2]
Maybe a good kick will
[nl2]do the trick!
[en2]
If you get too close,
[nl2]the thorn's will poke
[nl3]you.
[en2]
Well blast me
[nl2]barnacles! The time
[nl3]warp worked! Indio was[np]
[scl]telling the truth!
[scl]I've come to the
[scl]future! Did the water[np]
[scl]really dry up like
[scl]Indio said?!
[en1]
The crystal ball
[nl2]you're using for your
[nl3]time machine will lead[np]
[scl]us to a legendary
[scl]treasure, won't it?
[scl]Sorry, but we'll be[np]
[scl]taking it, then.
[en1]
We'll let your the
[nl2]townspeople handle the
[nl3]rest. Look forward to[np]
[scl]it!
[en1]
Press the [C$04] button
[nl2]to punch, hold it to
[nl3]guard! Okay!?
[en1]

[nl2] Hehehe, later!
[en1]
The 「town's treasure「
[nl2]is gone! You stole it,
[nl3]didn't you, Indio?! I[np]
[scl]just got a tip about
[scl]you!
[en1]

[nl2] You're under arrest!
[en1]
Thanks for assisting
[nl2]in the arrest, boys.
[nl3]Now we can be sure[np]
[scl]that Indio was the
[scl]leader of the mountain
[scl]bandits.
[en1]
Wow! You opened it!
[nl2]That key will probably
[nl3]open the blue door.[np]
[scl]Let's go there right
[scl]away.
[en1]
Isn't there some other
[nl2]way to look inside?
[en2]
Without getting
[nl2]closer, you can't see.
[en2]
[X$6A]Oh, there they
[nl2]are! What are they
[nl3]talking about?
[en2]
I didn't steal the
[nl2]crystal ball! I swear!
[nl3]But more importantly,[np]
[scl]they need to dig more
[scl]wells or the town will
[scl]run out of water! I[np]
[scl]asked the boy at the
[scl]lake to dig the holes,
[scl]can you find him and[np]
[scl]help him? Unless those
[scl]wells get dug, and
[scl]fast, the town will be[np]
[scl]in huge trouble!
[en2]
The town will run out
[nl2]of water? You asked
[nl3]the boy at the lake to[np]
[scl]dig wells? Enough
[scl]lies! Tell me where
[scl]you hid the 「town's[np]
[scl]treasure「!!
[en2]
Indio asked me for a
[nl2]favor... do you guys
[nl3]know where he is right[np]
[scl]now?
[en2]
Indio said this lake
[nl2]will dry up soon, so
[nl3]he asked me to dig[np]
[scl]some wells. To dig a
[scl]well, though, I need
[scl]the mysterious power[np]
[scl]these penguins have.
[scl]But these penguins are
[scl]in the middle of[np]
[scl]mating season and none
[scl]of them will leave the
[scl]lake. Can you help me
[scl]catch one?[np]
[scl][X$6A]    Sure, okay!
[scl]    Do it yourself![X$68]
[en1]
That's the spirit!
[nl2]I'll head back and
[nl3]wait for you guys to[np]
[scl]bring me a penguin.
[en1]
That's because.. I
[nl2]can't swim!
[en2]
You don't have
[nl2]anything to dig with?
[nl3]Okay, I'll give you my[np]
[scl]invention, a 「hole
[scl]digging machine「!  ..
[scl]is what I'd like to[np]
[scl]say, but I only have
[scl]the concept drawn up.
[scl]I'll give it to the[np]
[scl]kid who likes building
[scl]stuff the most.
[en2]
I'd like to give you
[nl2]the 「hole digging
[nl3]machine「 I made, but I[np]
[scl]only have the plan for
[scl]it. You have to find
[scl]the parts on your own.
[en1]
[F2]Received hole
[nl2]digging machine
[nl3]blueprints! I think[np]
[scl]I've seen these parts
[scl]before...
[en1]
My gut tells me there
[nl2]are [C$24] spots in town
[nl3]just right for digging[np]
[scl]a well.
[en1]
If we don't dig them
[nl2]fast, it'll be a
[nl3]disaster!
[en2]
[F2] You made a hole
[nl2]digging machine!
[en1]
But it's too heavy to
[nl2]lift. Max, you take
[nl3]it!
[en2]
Let's make Max carry
[nl2]it!
[en2]

[nl2] Get it together, Jack
[en2]
[SP$012C]Moo moo.
[nl2]TL: Moo moo.

Let's get closer and
[nl2]try something...
[en2]
[SP$012C]Moo moo
[nl2]TL: I'm really
[nl3]ticklish, so don't[np]
[scl]come any closer!
[en2]
You scoundrels! Is
[nl2]this any way to treat
[nl3]a lady?!
[en1]
You did it! [F2]Now
[nl2]the town will always
[nl3]have plenty of water.[np]
[scl]Thank you! I'll keep
[scl]this penguin. There's
[scl]something else I want[np]
[scl]help with. Oh, you
[scl]guys, I have something
[scl]interesting to tell[np]
[scl]you. If you want to
[scl]save Indio, get a
[scl]frog. The sheriff[np]
[scl]hates frogs more than
[scl]anything!
[en1]
Thanks to you kids,
[nl2]the town's water
[nl3]problems were solved.[np]
[scl]Now we have to save
[scl]Indio!
[en2]
Croak ribbit.
[nl2]TL: Curse those

[en2]
Geko geko
[nl2]TL: I'm so hungry..
[nl3]everything that moves[np]
[scl]looks like food...
[en2]
[F2]You got a frog!
[nl2]You earned it.
[en2]
Let's look for the
[nl2]blue door elevator. I
[nl3]think it was below the[np]
[scl]room I was trapped in.
[en2]
Yikes! A frog!! Help
[nl2]me!!
[en1]
The guy on the left is
[nl2]Benson! And I'm next
[nl3]to him. Where did you[np]
[scl]get this? I don't
[scl]remember posing for
[scl]this photograph.. You[np]
[scl]kids are time
[scl]travelers?! Please,
[scl]take this photograph[np]
[scl]and look for Benson!
[en2]
Eh? You know Benson?
[nl2]It's not that I don't
[nl3]believe you, but do[np]
[scl]you have any proof?
[en2]
You guys must be time
[nl2]travelers! I am sure
[nl3]you will be able to[np]
[scl]find Benson!
[en2]
Time, please protect
[nl2]these children...
[en2]
Which one do you think
[nl2]is good? Point to it.
[en2]
[SP$020C]I see, the
[nl2]one with just a
[nl3]window! Yeah, simple[np]
[scl]is good.
[en1]
[SP$020C]I see, the
[nl2]one with a door AND a
[nl3]window. Yeah, without[np]
[scl]a door, you can't get
[scl]inside, can you?
[en1]
[SP$020C]I see, the
[nl2]one with a door on
[nl3]top. Yeah, then if it[np]
[scl]snows, I can still get
[scl]out!
[en1]
[SP$020C]Oh, the one
[nl2]with lots of windows.
[nl3]Good idea, then it[np]
[scl]will be really bright
[scl]inside!
[en1]
Thanks! When I finish
[nl2]it, I'd like to show
[nl3]it to you, but there's[np]
[scl]still a long ways to
[scl]go. Come back when
[scl]you're adults.
[en1]
[C$32] isn't any
[nl2]good? Okay, then pick
[nl3]your favorite.
[en2]
Yippee! The door
[nl2]opened!
[en2]
Actually.. My... my
[nl2]hip went out and I
[nl3]can't move.
[en2]

[nl2] ... but,
[en1]
It seems like fun, so
[nl2]I'll do it!
[en1]
[F2]You got some
[nl2]dynamite! Equip it and
[nl3]use it with the [C$04][np]
[scl]button!
[en1]
Max, try to think
[nl2]before using an item.
[en2]
Can you come a little
[nl2]closer?
[en2]
Stop dawdling and use
[nl2]the dynamite to find
[nl3]an entrance!
[en2]
Want to try it with
[nl2]BOOM one shot?
[en2]
Who is holding the
[nl2]dynamite?
[en2]
Alright, I've taken
[nl2]the dynamite back.
[nl3]When I use this, it[np]
[scl]will send up a lot of
[scl]smoke, so don't get
[scl]lost.
[en1]
As long as our masks
[nl2]are on, you'll never
[nl3]get past us!
[en2]
It's too hard to push
[nl2]by hand...
[en2]

[nl2] It's pretty heavy...
[en2]
To use teamwork, we
[nl2]have to position
[nl3]ourselves better.
[en2]
If we pull it like
[nl2]this, we'll be
[nl3]squished!
[en2]

[nl2] Want to get down?
[en2]
Without a bridge, we
[nl2]can't cross.
[en2]
Captain, what's the
[nl2]hurry? But even in a
[nl3]hurry, your face looks[np]
[scl]great.
[en2]
I wonder if something
[nl2]would happen if I
[nl3]smacked it.

If you don't hurry,
[nl2]the Mammoth Brothers

[en2]
You're pretty bold to
[nl2]try to steal anything
[nl3]from us! I think the[np]
[scl]punk with the hat will
[scl]be the first to taste
[scl]our Dance of Death!
[en1]

[nl2] So you're the leader?!
[en2]
Don't think you can
[nl2]escape from us!
[en2]

Listen to what they're
[nl2]saying!
[en2]
If you don't push it
[nl2]quickly, the Mammoth
[nl3]guys will wake up.

If you return to the

If you return to the

Thank goodness he was

[en2]
It's a message Benson
[nl2]left for us. What does
[nl3]it mean?
[en2]

[nl2] Is something there?
[en2]
Come here and look at
[nl2]the blueprint!
[en2]
What is this
[nl2]picture..?
[en2]

[nl2] Oh, it's Benson!
[en2]
Indio came to see
[nl2]Benson. He said the
[nl3]town was in trouble.
[en2]
The crystal ball that
[nl2]leads to Maverick's
[nl3]treasure is called the[np]
[scl]Blue Crystal, right?
[en2]
.. What is this
[nl2]picture?
[en2]
Well, if it isn't
[nl2]Benson!
[en2]
It's a picture of when
[nl2]Indio met with Benson.
[en2]
The 「town's treasure「
[nl2]was in Benson's hou..
[nl3]ho.. Achoo!!! house.[np]
[scl]I'm sure of it.
[en2]
What's with this
[nl2]picture?
[en2]
It's Benson! He was a
[nl2]strong, fine man.
[en2]
It's Indio! He lives
[nl2]on the other side of
[nl3]the penguin lake with[np]
[scl]his daughter.
[en2]
It's the 「town's
[nl2]treasure.「 But Indio
[nl3]said it was part of a[np]
[scl]time machine.
[en2]
Where'd you get this
[nl2]picture?!
[en2]
It's my husband. When
[nl2]did he take this
[nl3]photograph..?
[en2]
It's the man who came
[nl2]to see my husband. He
[nl3]said he knew how to[np]
[scl]travel through time...
[scl]I wonder if it was
[scl]true.
[en2]
It's the crystal ball
[nl2]my husband found.
[en2]

[nl2] What is this picture?!
[en2]

[nl2] It's my dad!
[en2]

[nl2] I dunno!

[scl]It might be scary, but
[scl]wind will come from[np]
[scl]below, so it should be
[scl]okay. Let's go.
[en1]
Who would have thought
[nl2]there was a balloon
[nl3]hidden here?
[en2]
We have to think fast.
[nl2]With our weights...
[nl3]someone heavy should[np]
[scl]go on the left, and
[scl]the two others will
[scl]pump from the right[np]
[scl]side.
[en1]
[SP$00D3]This is my
[nl2]greatest invention.
[nl3]People thought it was[np]
[scl]impossible for humans
[scl]to fly, but this hot
[scl]air balloon allows[np]
[scl]humans to do just
[scl]that. This is the
[scl]treasure I leave to[np]
[scl]any adventurer who can
[scl]find it. It's also the
[scl]only way to escape[np]
[scl]from the dungeon. I
[scl]pray this device still
[scl]works when you find[np]
[scl]it.
[scl]  -Captain Maverick
[en2]
Let's hurry and push
[nl2]it.
[en2]

[nl2]        [C$12][X$7E]
[en1]
Hurray! The balloon is
[nl2]inflating! Let's hurry
[nl3]and get in!
[en1]
I'll let you have my
[nl2]「soccer shoes「 if you
[nl3]go diving for them in[np]
[scl]the lake.
[en2]
[SP$020D]Come on, you
[nl2]aren't even wearing
[nl3]「soccer shoes「 so how[np]
[scl]are you going to play
[scl]soccer? Come back when
[scl]you wise up.
[en2]
If you don't go
[nl2]underwater, you can't
[nl3]reach the shoes, but[np]
[scl]it looks like the
[scl]water will hurt your
[scl]eyes~
[en2]
Can you help me?[X$6A]
[nl2]    Okay.
[nl3]    No way.[X$68]
[en1]

[nl2] Oof, that's harsh.
[en2]
Use [C$0A] to change the
[nl2]leader and bring them
[nl3]to the pot one by one.[np]
[scl]Then, press [C$48]!!
[en2]
Seems like we could
[nl2]have just filled it
[nl3]from the river...
[en2]
Sakes alive am I
[nl2]tired...
[en2]
Let's try it like
[nl2]them. They said to
[nl3]position ourselves[np]
[scl]equally around the
[scl]pot, right?
[en2]
Hm, something seems
[nl2]off. Maybe our
[nl3]positions aren't[np]
[scl]right?
[en1]
Yay! We lifted the
[nl2]pot!!
[en1]
Half the water
[nl2]splashed out! Thanks,
[nl3][team] Team, we were[np]
[scl]in hot water. Now we
[scl]can lift the pot
[scl]ourselves.
[en1]
After you get the
[nl2]「fish hook「 back from
[nl3]Jim, show it to our[np]
[scl]leader. He's pretty
[scl]bummed out over it...
[en2]

[nl2] !! A bite!!
[en1]
This is a big one!
[nl2]It's too big for me to
[nl3]pull it in alone![np]
[scl]Someone, help me reel
[scl]it in!
[en1]
It's heavy, so it has
[nl2]to be something big!
[nl3]Don't stand there,[np]
[scl]come and help!
[en2]
Hurry! It'll get
[nl2]away!!
[en2]

[nl2]          1[SP$023B]
[en1]
[F2]Max got the 
[nl2]swimming goggles!
[nl3][np]
[scl]You can use them with
[scl][C$04] to see underwater.
[scl][np]
[scl][X$6A]Ugh, it's just another
[scl]piece of junk...
[scl][np]
[scl]I thought it was
[scl]gonna be the big
[scl]one...[np]
[scl]To use the goggles, 
[scl]open the menu with 
[scl]START and equip them.[np]
[scl]You got it?
[en1]
Fugo fugo
[nl2]TL: Oh, even if you
[nl3]land on us, it won't[np]
[scl]hurt you, so don't
[scl]worry.
[en2]
What's this? 「Camp
[nl2]knowledge「? Point at
[nl3]each line with [C$0C][np]
[scl]to read them.
[en2]
When you think 「Huh?!「
[nl2]press the [C$02] button.
[nl3]When you think 「That's[np]
[scl]fishy!「 press the [C$02]
[scl]button! There's a lot
[scl]to explore!
[en2]
When you see the [C$36],
[nl2]push [C$02]!
[en2]
Use actions with [C$04].
[nl2]Equip an item from the
[nl3]START menu and use it[np]
[scl]with [C$04]. Let's try it
[scl]out.
[en2]
When you're in
[nl2]trouble, try
[nl3]whistling! When your[np]
[scl]team is split up, just
[scl]whistle!
[en2]
Squeak squeak
[nl2]TL: I'm a prankster
[nl3]mouse. If you hear a[np]
[scl]scream, it's probably
[scl]thanks to me.
[en2]
[X$6A]This seems to
[nl2]be a path for mice.
[en2]
[team] Team, please!
[nl2]I'm begging you! Do
[nl3]somethingggg!!
[en2]
Find the hole the
[nl2]mouse used to get in
[nl3]here and then chase it[np]
[scl]away! Pretty please,
[scl][team] Team!
[en2]
[X$6A]Find a hole in
[nl2]the tent where a mice
[nl3]could come in, and[np]
[scl]then make it so he'll
[scl]never think about
[scl]coming in here again.[np]
[scl]Pretty please, [team]
[scl]Team!
[en2]
[X$6A]You plugged the
[nl2]hole in the tent
[nl3]earlier, but the mouse[np]
[scl]ran away? I wonder if
[scl]he's gone for good.
[en2]
Squeaky squeak!
[nl2]TL: Dangit! I'm
[nl3]trapped! Don't lay a[np]
[scl]finger on me!
[en2]
Squeeeeak eeek!!
[nl2]TL: Don't pull there!!
[nl3]aaah!
[en1]
I want to show my
[nl2]thanks to you, [team]
[nl3]Team. Come closer to[np]
[scl]me.
[en2]
[F2]Received an identical
[nl2]scarf from Miss Gina! 
[nl3][np]Keep it a secret,
[scl]okay?
[en1]
I think it's awfully
[nl2]nice to help people in
[nl3]trouble. If you see[np]
[scl]more people in
[scl]trouble, be sure to
[scl]help them out, too,[np]
[scl]okay?
[en1]
You put items in this
[nl2]wooden box. You can't
[nl3]put them in from that[np]
[scl]far away. Get a little
[scl]closer.
[en2]
Yes, you put items in
[nl2]this box. Don't worry,
[nl3]it's not like the item[np]
[scl]will disappear or
[scl]anything.
[en2]
Don't you get it?
[nl2]Don't give ME the
[nl3]item, put it in the[np]
[scl]box. Try checking the
[scl]box with [C$46].
[en2]
It seems that is the
[nl2]wrong item. Why don't
[nl3]you try with another[np]
[scl]item? You'll be glad
[scl]you did.
[en1]
That's correct. This
[nl2]box multiplies Luck
[nl3]Rocks. Go ahead and[np]
[scl]take them.
[en1]
[X$6A][SP$0339][num] Luck Rock turned
[nl2]into [C$28]. This is what
[nl3]is called a 「miracle.「
[en1]
If you can do this,
[nl2]then you're an item
[nl3]master. Be sure to[np]
[scl]keep studying every.
[en1]
I forgot to mention
[nl2]it, but no more Luck
[nl3]Rocks will come out.[np]
[scl]Life isn't that easy.
[en1]
Let's get closer and
[nl2]take it.
[en2]
Let's chase it down
[nl2]and grab it!
[en2]
Without diving
[nl2]underwater, we can't
[nl3]reach it... I wonder[np]
[scl]how one can dive
[scl]underwater.
[en2]
Guwah! How can you be
[nl2]stumped by such a
[nl3]simple trap. For[np]
[scl]shame, kids. These
[scl]「Patchies「 pirates are
[scl]ordered 2, 1, 3 from[np]
[scl]the left. That's a
[scl]huge hint! If you
[scl]still don't get it,[np]
[scl]you are just dumb.
[en1]
The Patchies blocking
[nl2]the cave are really in
[nl3]the way. What if we[np]
[scl]tried knocking them
[scl]over with a ball?
[en1]
Try bumping into logs
[nl2]with 「Dash「 and then
[nl3]lift the log with[np]
[scl][C$48].
[en1]
You want to save Miss
[nl2]Gina, don't you? Then
[nl3]hurry up and find the[np]
[scl]ball! There's a path
[scl]next to where Blue
[scl]collapsed.
[en1]
What should you do
[nl2]from here? All you can
[nl3]do is leave the island[np]
[scl]on that ship, right?
[scl]You have to open the
[scl]unopenable door in the[np]
[scl]ship to move it. Did
[scl]you already meet a
[scl]fairy? If not, then[np]
[scl]look along the coast
[scl]in the North and save
[scl]the fairy. Then you[np]
[scl]can open the door.
[en1]
[X$6A][SP$0339]You got [X$6B] Luck Rocks.
[en1]
What are you doing?
[nl2]What? I won't do
[nl3]anything. Come closer.
[en2]
What's inside the
[nl2]chest?
[en2]
Gah! I have [C$1E] Luck
[nl2]Rocks left... dangit..
[nl3]my store is ruined!![np]
[scl]Get out of here!
[en1]
What are you going to
[nl2]do with all those Luck
[nl3]Rocks? Weren't you[np]
[scl]supposed to be
[scl]collecting firewood?
[en2]
Don't you have
[nl2]anything better to do?
[nl3]Buzz off!
[en2]
Maybe that was a
[nl2]little mean to Jim.
[en2]
Hey, guess what, you
[nl2]guys? You have [C$1E]
[nl3]Luck Rocks. Didn't[np]
[scl]notice? I'll take pity
[scl]on you and give you
[scl][num] Luck Rock for the[np]
[scl]road. You should
[scl]really quit while
[scl]you're ahead.
[en1]
[SP$0339]You received
[nl2][num] Luck Rock from
[nl3]Jim. He might not be[np]
[scl]so bad after all.
[en2]
These are the Luck
[nl2]Rocks we painstakingly
[nl3]collected. Don't think[np]
[scl]you'll take them all
[scl]for nothing. Give it a
[scl]try if you're feeling[np]
[scl]lucky.
[en2]
Darnit, Jim! Those are
[nl2]the Luck Rocks we
[nl3]worked so hard to[np]
[scl]get...
[en2]
Is it okay to do this?
[nl2]If Miss Gina finds
[nl3]out, I'll get slapped[np]
[scl]up and down by my
[scl]mommy again...
[en2]
That's why I said you
[nl2]should stop... I guess
[nl3]we'll just have to go[np]
[scl]look for more Luck
[scl]Rocks.
[en2]
Shall we try getting
[nl2]closer?
[en2]

[nl3][C$46] Check the crates[np]
[scl]again please.
[en2]
Chirp chirpy!
[nl2]TL:It's true! I don't
[nl3]know! Believe me!!
[en2]
Let's try a dash with
[nl2]the [C$04] button.
[en2]
How can we get it, I
[nl2]wonder?
[en2]
Then show it to me.
[nl2]Hurry up and prepare
[nl3]for departure!
[en2]
Why is there a hole
[nl2]here?
[en2]

[nl2] Let's give it a smack.
[en2]
That's no good! Your
[nl2]timing is off. Let's
[nl3]try again. On the[np]
[scl]count of [C$24], push the
[scl][C$02] button!
[en1]
Come on! Push the [C$02]
[nl2]button!
[en1]

[nl2] What is this picture?
[en2]
This man was with
[nl2]Indio.
[en2]
This isn't a bad
[nl2]person!
[en2]

[nl2] Indio had it...
[en2]
Forgot? I'll tell you.
[nl2]Hurry and come here.
[en2]
Come play again. It
[nl2]seems Jim is cooking
[nl3]up a new game.
[en2]
Keep this a secret...
[nl2]but Jim.. has a crush
[nl3]on Miss Gina.
[en2]
[X$79]Mash it to move it!
[nl2]   [C$42]       [C$12][X$7E]
[en1]
[X$79]Push it to move it!
[nl2]        [C$42][X$7E]
[en1]
[X$79]Mash it!
[nl2]        [C$12][X$7E]
[en1]
What's wrong? Don't
[nl2]quit now!
[en1]
You know, green is my
[nl2]favorite color. Luck
[nl3]Rock yellow is my[np]
[scl]favorite, too.
[en2]

[nl2] Hehe, that tickles.
[en2]
This red scarf is my
[nl2]trademark. Remember
[nl3]that, okay?
[en2]
There's nothing in my
[nl2]pocket.
[en2]
There's really nothing
[nl2]in there, okay?
[en2]
Why do you keep poking
[nl2]me there?!?!
[en2]

[nl2] Stop it this instant!
[en2]
There are important
[nl2]instructions on that
[nl3]paper. Get closer and[np]
[scl]give it a good look.
[scl]When you want to leave
[scl]this screen, press [C$04][np]
[scl]or select [C$44] and
[scl]press [C$02]. Then the
[scl]camping can really[np]
[scl]begin!
[en1]
Haha, look! It came
[nl2]the other day.
[en1]
Ooh ooh!
[nl2]TL: I'm glad you 
[nl3]came, Winky.[np] 
[scl]Today is your
[scl]16th birthday.[np]
[scl]I can hardly believe
[scl]how much you
[scl]have grown...[np]
[scl]Time passes by so
[scl]quickly, you know.
[en1]

[nl2]Listen up, Winky!
[en1]
If you don't
[nl2]understand something
[nl3]written here, point[np]
[scl]your cursor at it.
[en2]
Please clean off the
[nl2]top [C$22] windows. I
[nl3]can't reach them, but[np]
[scl]I'm sure you kids can
[scl]think of a way.
[en2]
There's a dangerous
[nl2]hole in the floor, so
[nl3]I want you to cover it[np]
[scl]with a board and
[scl]hammer it into place.
[en2]
I want you to move the
[nl2]table on the right
[nl3]side of the room to[np]
[scl]the left side. Be
[scl]careful you don't
[scl]squish yourselves.
[en2]
Thanks to you kids, it
[nl2]turned out alright! I
[nl3]hate to ask so much,[np]
[scl]but please take care
[scl]of the rest, as well.
[en2]
Bring some other kids
[nl2]over.
[en2]
Once you get to this
[nl2]age, it's hard to
[nl3]shout. Come a litle[np]
[scl]closer.
[en2]

[nl2] Nice work!
[en2]
There's nothing but
[nl2]clocks inside here. If
[nl3]that's alright, you[np]
[scl]can take the key from
[scl]beneath the model
[scl]boat.
[en2]
[SP$00D3]Is the
[nl2]mansion key under
[nl3]here?
[en2]
It's nice to
[nl2]redecorate a room
[nl3]sometimes.
[en2]

[nl2] It looks heavy.
[en2]
The floor still has
[nl2]that hole in it, so
[nl3]it's impossible to[np]
[scl]move it.
[en2]
I hope granny doesn't
[nl2]fall in the hole and
[nl3]hurt herself...
[en2]
This would be perfect
[nl2]for covering a hole.
[en2]
We lifted it! Move
[nl2]with [C$08] and press
[nl3][C$02] to drop it.
[en1]
You can't tell without
[nl2]getting closer.
[en2]
It seems too far to
[nl2]reach!
[en2]
It's caked with dust!
[nl2]Gross!
[en2]

[nl2] The sun is so bright!
[en2]
[X$79]Let's clean windows!
[nl2]   [C$42]       [C$12][X$7E]
[en1]

[nl2] Go home! Leave!
[en2]
[X$79]Pull his cheeks!
[nl2]        [C$42][X$7E]
[en1]
[X$79]Push his nose!
[nl2]        [C$12][X$7E]
[en1]

[nl2]        [C$42][X$7E]
[en1]

[nl2] A zipper..?
[en1]
No, it can't be!!
[nl2]Nooo!
[en1]
I'll let you live to
[nl2]see another day.
[nl3]Remember this!
[en1]
Maybe I'll sing a song
[nl2]until the food is
[nl3]ready. I'll sing my[np]
[scl]true feelings.
[en1]
Ouch! What was that
[nl2]for?
[en1]
Blub glub blub
[nl2]TL: Even if there's
[nl3]bait in front of me, I[np]
[scl]won't eat it~. My
[scl]tummy is full.
[en2]
Blubble glubble
[nl2]TL: This is a tiny
[nl3]pond, so even if I[np]
[scl]swim fast, there's
[scl]nowhere to go.
[en2]
...He looks like he
[nl2]wants to start a
[nl3]fight.
[en2]
Blub mub blub!
[nl2]TL: You aren't
[nl3]thinking of catching[np]
[scl]me, are you? Hah, I'd
[scl]like to see you try.
[scl]After I grab a hold of[np]
[scl]your bait, you'd best
[scl]be warned, if you try
[scl]to pull too fast, I'll[np]
[scl]get away!
[en2]
Blubble glub glub
[nl2]TL: Listen, I've made
[nl3]hundreds of fisherman[np]
[scl]cry with my extreme
[scl]flipper strength.
[scl]After I take the bait,[np]
[scl]if you just hold the
[scl][C$08] without letting
[scl]go, you don't stand a[np]
[scl]chance. Got it?
[en2]
[X$6A]If you want to
[nl2]learn about a button,
[nl3]move the [C$0C] mark[np]
[scl]to it and press [C$02].
[en2]
You can use the [C$02]
[nl2]button for searching
[nl3]or talking to people.
[en1]
The [C$04] button uses
[nl2]the item you've
[nl3]equipped in the menu.
[en1]
The [C$06] button opens
[nl2]the menu, just like
[nl3]the 「start「 button[np]
[scl]does. You can change
[scl]your equipped items
[scl]from the menu.
[en1]
The [C$00] button blows
[nl2]your whistle. It
[nl3]brings your team[np]
[scl]together.
[en1]
The [C$14] button shows
[nl2]everyone's HP and
[nl3]their currently[np]
[scl]equipped items.
[en1]
The [C$0A] button changes
[nl2]the leader.
[en1]
The 「start「 button
[nl2]opens the menu, just
[nl3]like the [C$06] button[np]
[scl]does. You can change
[scl]your equipped items
[scl]from the menu.
[en1]
The 「select「 button is
[nl2]for saving in your
[nl3]diary. Be sure to save[np]
[scl]often.
[en1]
The [C$08] is used for
[nl2]moving or selecting
[nl3]command panels.
[en1]

[nl2] Let's get closer!
[en2]

[nl2] What could it mean?
[en2]
I wonder if these
[nl2]numbers mean
[nl3]something.
[en2]
Maybe it makes sense
[nl2]upside down?
[en2]

[nl2] The answer is simple.
[en2]
[X$79]Push a direction!
[nl2]        [C$42][X$7E]
[en1]

[nl2] Sucker?!
[en2]
Enter the numbers with
[nl2][C$02] and press OK when
[nl3]you're done!
[en2]

[nl2] Something seems off...
[en2]
There must be a switch
[nl2]somewhere!
[en2]
Pii pii!
[nl2]TL: Stay out of our
[nl3]way or you'll get[np]
[scl]hurt!
[en2]
[X$79]Push a direction!
[nl2]        [C$42][X$7E]
[en1]
You found my weak
[nl2]spot! Forgive me! I'll
[nl3]never prank anyone[np]
[scl]again!
[en1]
Squeak squeak!
[nl2]TL: It's my glorious
[nl3]tail! I don't care if[np]
[scl]you touch it!
[en2]
Squeak~!
[nl2]TL: That tickles! Stop
[nl3]it!
[en2]
There's no way I can
[nl2]lift this... Maybe if
[nl3]we work together?
[en2]
I really want it, but
[nl2]I can't reach it.
[nl3]Maybe there's some way[np]
[scl]to knock it down?
[en2]
Stop it! Please stop!
[nl2]Anywhere but my
[nl3]ears...
[en2]
Well, that's just too
[nl2]much to look past, now
[nl3]isn't it.
[en2]

[nl3]Let's run while he's[np]
[scl]distracted.
[en2]
Full of nutrition! It
[nl2]might be good for
[nl3]restoring health. But[np]
[scl]you can't eat it
[scl]unless you are
[scl]injured.
[en2]
This is.. probably
[nl2]where we are right
[nl3]now!
[en2]
I want to get it, but
[nl2]it's too far away.
[en2]
They have something to
[nl2]do with the guys who
[nl3]took Miss Gina, right?[np]
[scl]Let's chase them down
[scl]and find out!
[en2]

[nl2] Found a key!
[en1]
「Pirate Ship Lysander「
[nl2]is written on it. The
[nl3]name makes it sound a[np]
[scl]lot cooler than it
[scl]looks.
[en2]
It says:
[nl2]  「My son Blue and
[nl3]Blue's mother「
[en2]
There's a drawing of a
[nl2]pirate.
[en2]
Fight or flee? ....
[nl2]..... .... RUNNNN!!
[en2]
You dummies aren't
[nl2]planning on going
[nl3]after Miss Gina, are[np]
[scl]you? You've never even
[scl]been in a fight. You
[scl]probably don't even[np]
[scl]know you can use [C$14]
[scl]to display your
[scl]health, do you? If[np]
[scl]your health drops to
[scl]zero, it's game over,
[scl]man! Just wait for the[np]
[scl]police to get here.
[scl]Life isn't like a
[scl]video game, you know.[np]
[scl]Later.
[en1]

[nl2]          2[SP$023B]
[en1]

[nl2]          [C$24][SP$032D]
[en1]
[F2]Alright, it's
[nl2]open!
[en1]
I feel like I've seen
[nl2]this 「Do not enter「
[nl3]sign before...
[en2]
It seems like the tent
[nl2]we're in right now...
[en2]
Miss Gina must be in
[nl2]the cave to the North!
[en2]
There's a big lake by
[nl2]the cave? Let's use
[nl3]that as a landmark.
[en2]
This picture is awful!
[nl2]Miss Gina is much
[nl3]prettier!
[en2]
What if we put one
[nl2]of us on the left and
[nl3]right, and the last[np]
[scl]guy either on top or
[scl]bottom?
[en2]
The pirates took the
[nl2]「rope「 and ran off. I
[nl3]don't know where they[np]
[scl]went, but they must
[scl]have left footprints
[scl]in the sand!
[en1]
Did you already open
[nl2]the treasure chest in
[nl3]the forest?
[en1]
There's a barking dog
[nl2]under this tree. He
[nl3]looks mean, so let's[np]
[scl]smack him with a ball
[scl]to teach him some
[scl]manners.
[en1]
Lack of bridge
[nl2]stressing you out? The
[nl3]leaf near the river is[np]
[scl]said to become
[scl]enormous when watered.
[en1]
Did you open the red
[nl2]chest where Winky
[nl3]saved you guys? .. how[np]
[scl]unfortunate.
[en1]
Are you using the
[nl2]「Hammer「? Try
[nl3]hammering the peg in[np]
[scl]front of the pipe! You
[scl]can move the pipe with
[scl][C$48]. Good luck!
[en1]

[nl2] Sweet, it opened!
[en1]
[X$6A][SP$0339]You found a Luck Rock!
[nl2]You have [X$6C] now!
[en1]
It says 「Danger ahead!
[nl2]You WILL be injured!「
[nl3]... what should I do?
[en2]
Oh, that's the
[nl2]colonel's official
[nl3]permission slip! How[np]
[scl]did you get it? It's
[scl]real, right? Well,
[scl]alright, go on ahead.
[en1]
Can I be a little more
[nl2]surprised?
[en2]
She was a tomboy with
[nl2]a bad mouth, but I
[nl3]feel a little lonely[np]
[scl]now that she's gone.
[en1]
Blub glub!
[nl2]TL: Don't worry about
[nl3]me, I can get back to[np]
[scl]the lake on my own.
[en2]
Hurry and show the
[nl2]「fishing hook「 to our
[nl3]leader!
[en2]
I see, just as I
[nl2]thought! Oh, sorry, I
[nl3]actually don't have a[np]
[scl]clue.
[en2]
Hurry up and choose
[nl2]「fishing hook「 from
[nl3]the [C$4A] panel and[np]
[scl]press the [C$02] button.
[en2]
We need to call the
[nl2]police on the
[nl3]mainland. Camp is over[np]
[scl]now, man. Let's go
[scl]back to the mainland
[scl]together, alright?
[en2]
I misjudged you guys!
[nl2]But who's the idiot
[nl3]who stole their[np]
[scl]treasure?
[en2]
I wonder what's for
[nl2]lunch... isn't what I
[nl3]should be thinking[np]
[scl]about right now.
[en2]
A small red key might
[nl2]fit this keyhole!
[en2]
A small lanky blue key
[nl2]might fit this
[nl3]keyhole.
[en2]
A great big green key
[nl2]might fit this
[nl3]keyhole!
[en2]
Any color key should
[nl2]fit this keyhole!
[en2]
[F2]Dorothy received
[nl2]the firewood! err,
[nl3]what?
[en1]
Hey you! If it isn't
[nl2][team] Team. So you're
[nl3]not dead yet.
[en1]
Upon closer
[nl2]inspection, you see 3
[nl3]of them.
[en2]

[nl2] Why won't this open?
[en2]
Something's wrong. Get
[nl2]on 3 sides of the
[nl3]boulder and [C$48]![np]
[scl]It's the only way.
[en1]
Something's not right.
[nl2]Put one on top, two on
[nl3]bottom, and [C$48]![np]
[scl]It's the only way.
[en1]
To use teamwork, we
[nl2]have to position
[nl3]ourselves better.
[en1]
If you want a tip,
[nl2]choose Luck Rock from
[nl3]the [C$4A] menu.
[en2]
Hurry back to the
[nl2]ship! But if you want
[nl3]more Luck Rocks, try a[np]
[scl]house in town. Good
[scl]luck!
[en1]
Did you find a tent?
[nl2]You should listen to
[nl3]what the adult inside[np]
[scl]says.
[en1]
To continue in the
[nl2]underground cave, one
[nl3]person has to operate[np]
[scl]the machine while the
[scl]other two go ahead.
[scl]The switch is next to[np]
[scl]the shutter, so don't
[scl]miss it!
[en1]
The bully monkeys'
[nl2]boss is a gorilla. I
[nl3]bet he'd be happy if[np]
[scl]you recorded a girl
[scl]gorilla's voice and
[scl]played it back for[np]
[scl]him!
[en1]
Thank you come again~!
[nl2]Received [X$6B]
[nl3]Luck Rocks!
[en1]
Who are you!?
[en2]
It's dangerous, so you
[nl2]really shouldn't go.
[en2]
Our camping island is
[nl2]this way! Wait for us,
[nl3]Miss Gina!!
[en2]
By the way, who has
[nl2]the tape recorder? I
[nl3]hate to ask, but could[np]
[scl]you give it back to
[scl]me?
[en2]
If you want to know
[nl2]about the town, why
[nl3]not ask the sheriff?
[en1]
You can destroy the
[nl2]monster flowers in
[nl3]「Death Lake「 by[np]
[scl]kicking their wiggling
[scl]roots to open the
[scl]flower, and then[np]
[scl]hitting their flower!
[en1]
Did you listen to the
[nl2]request of Indio's
[nl3]daughter to the east?[np]
[scl]Didn't your teacher
[scl]tell you to help out
[scl]those in need?
[en1]
There must be a water
[nl2]supply store in town.
[nl3]If you show him that[np]
[scl]picture, I bet he'll
[scl]be surprised!
[en1]
The old lady next door
[nl2]is in quite a fix. Why
[nl3]don't you lend a hand?
[en1]
It seems like the
[nl2]captured Indio had
[nl3]something to say! Why[np]
[scl]not give him a listen?
[en1]
I saw the man Indio
[nl2]mentioned east of the
[nl3]lake.
[en1]
Penguins and humans
[nl2]alike are drawn to
[nl3]those like themselves.[np]
[scl]Find penguins who move
[scl]the same way. I'm sure
[scl]they will make good[np]
[scl]couples.
[en1]
Didn't we see this at
[nl2]the plumber's house?
[en1]
Did you try digging 3
[nl2]holes? One hole is
[nl3]blocked by a cow, but[np]
[scl]if you tickle his
[scl]nose, he'll move for
[scl]you.
[en1]
In order to chase off
[nl2]the sheriff, you are
[nl3]gonna need a frog![np]
[scl]You can catch frogs
[scl]with a fishing rod,[np]
[scl]but you can't just
[scl]throw it out there.[np]
[scl]You have to cast it on
[scl]a leaf, and watch for
[scl]the frog's reaction.[np]
[scl]Sorry if you knew
[scl]that already!
[en1]
Benson is hiding in an
[nl2]empty house. But you
[nl3]can't get get in[np]
[scl]unless the house is
[scl]built with a door.
[en1]
That's the only way!
[en2]
Are you checking
[nl2]various things with
[nl3]the [C$02] button?
[en1]
Just make a time warp!
[en1]
Fortunately, the board
[nl2]was only blocked on
[nl3]top, and the bottom is[np]
[scl]still open.
[en2]
Give it a try?
[en2]
Let's get close and
[nl2]check it out.
[en2]
You can't put in any
[nl2]more Luck Rocks while
[nl3]you are playing!
[en2]
It's too small to
[nl2]read. Maybe if we got
[nl3]closer...
[en2]
Shock! The electric
[nl2]man-beast![np]
[nl3]「If you hit electric
[scl]man three times[np]
[scl]in his chest, a
[scl]roulette pops out.[np]
[scl]Hit it once more,
[scl]and you'll receive a
[scl]Luck Rock prize![np]
[scl]It costs 2 Luck
[scl]Rocks to play.「 [np]
[scl]Wow...
[scl]What an ancient game.[en2]
Come over here a
[nl2]second.
[en2]
It's [X$6B] Luck Rocks.[X$6A]
[nl2]    Okay

[en1]
Fine, [X$6B] Luck Rocks?

If you're going to act
[nl2]like that about it
[nl3]then I want [X$6B][np]
[scl]and not one Luck Rock
[scl]fewer!
[en1]
Okay, [X$6B] Luck Rocks?[X$6A]
[nl2]    Okay
[nl3]    Can you go lower?[X$68]
[en1]
Well, who needs you,

[en1]
Ready to pay up?[X$6A]
[nl2]    Okay
[nl3]    Never![X$68]
[en1]
Heheh! Thanks, pal.
[nl2]It's over there, so
[nl3]use it whenever you[np]
[scl]want.
[en1]
You kids are tough
[nl2]customers, not giving
[nl3]me any profit at all.
[en1]
I would have taken
[nl2][X$6B] for that...
[nl3]what a pretty profit!
[en1]
Trade for [X$6B] Rocks?[X$6A]
[nl2]    Okay
[nl3]    Can you go lower?[X$68]
[en1]
But what will you do
[nl2]with it?
[en2]
By the way, how many
[nl2]Luck Rocks do you kids
[nl3]have? What?! Only[np]
[scl][X$6B]? Fine, I'll
[scl]cut you a deal. If you
[scl]can answer my[np]
[scl]questions, I'll sell
[scl]it to you for [X$6B]
[scl]Luck Rocks.

A long time ago, there

[nl2]your stuff! Here, take
[nl3]it for [X$6B] Luck[np]
[scl]Rocks.
[en1]
It's over there. Use
[nl2]it whenever you want.
[nl3]You kids are some[np]
[scl]tough customers, not
[scl]letting me have any
[scl]profit!
[en1]
Too bad, try your luck
[nl2]again later.
[en1]
By the way, do you
[nl2]kids have any Luck
[nl3]Rocks? What? Not a[np]
[scl]single one?! Fine, if
[scl]you can answer my
[scl]questions, I'll give[np]
[scl]it to you for free.
[en1]
Wow, you kids know
[nl2]your stuff. Alright,
[nl3]you can have it for[np]
[scl]free.
[en1]
Oh, [team] Team! You
[nl2]guys are alright!
[nl3]What's wrong? I'm the[np]
[scl]PE teacher, Arnold.
[scl]Don't you remember me?
[en1]

[nl2] It's not usable...

Likely to come from[np]
[nl2]behind.
[en2]
It's missing balls!
[nl2]Don't you have
[nl3]something else you can[np]
[scl]use?
[en2]
This is hard enough we
[nl2]can use it. But, we
[nl3]only have [X$6B], so[np]
[scl]we have to be careful.
[en1]
[X$79][C$08] to aim! [C$04] to exit.

This is payback for

If you're playing

It looks just right to

Oh, ready for a

The cord connects to
[nl2]the neighboring cave,
[nl3]but...

[nl2] What on earth is it?

The power cable seems
[nl2]to be connected to
[nl3]this.

[X$79]Push it!
[nl2]        [C$42][X$7E]
[en1]
Let's get a closer
[nl2]look.
[en2]
Let's see what it
[nl2]says... something
[nl3]about plants.. blah[np]
[scl]blah.. plants.. nope.
[scl]You can't make heads
[scl]or tails of it.[np]
[scl]Without a specialist
[scl]here, this is
[scl]incomprehensible.
[en2]
Okay, I'll stay here
[nl2]and examine these
[nl3]notes.
[en1]
March 22
[nl2]I found a strange
[nl3]ball. It looks like[np]
[scl]some sort of crystal.
[scl]When I was examining
[scl]the Baobab tree in the[np]
[scl]center of this island,
[scl]I noticed a parasitic
[scl]plant was stealing its[np]
[scl]nutrition, making it
[scl]easier to take the
[scl]oil. The parasite[np]
[scl]seems to instill its
[scl]host with more
[scl]vigor... I hope this[np]
[scl]crystal ball doesn't
[scl]fall into the wrong
[scl]hands.[np]
[scl][SP$0121]Lately,
[scl]strange things have
[scl]been happening on this[np]
[scl]island. My dog, Socks,
[scl]has been acting
[scl]strangely ever since[np]
[scl]he went into the
[scl]jungle... I'm quite
[scl]concerned.
[en2]
Did you go further
[nl2]into the island? It
[nl3]seems they take an oil[np]
[scl]from the Baobab tree
[scl]in the center of the
[scl]island.
[en2]
It looks like he was
[nl2]researching the
[nl3]parasitic plant's[np]
[scl]reaction to a certain
[scl]liquid. The strange
[scl]that is, that liquid[np]
[scl]is common salt water!
[scl]I have no idea why it
[scl]reacts to salt water,[np]
[scl]but I made this for
[scl]you.
[en1]
[F2]Received Prof.
[nl2]Marlowe's saltwater
[nl3]spray! Yikes, salty!
[en1]
I guess I'll give this
[nl2]to.. a clever-seeming
[nl3]lanky boy like me..[np]
[scl]Jack!
[en2]
I'll let that lanky
[nl2]fellow, Jack, have it,
[nl3]so come get it.
[en2]
You might be able to
[nl2]crack the riddle. I'll
[nl3]give this to you. Use[np]
[scl]it wisely!
[en1]
What kind of water is
[nl2]it?
[en2]
Salt water... is it
[nl2]from the ocean?
[en2]
Oh, that made a great
[nl2]photo! Good work,
[nl3]boys.
[en1]
The Luck Rocks are
[nl2]gone!
[en1]

[nl2] Hey, open up!!

If they raise the
[nl2]lever, the door
[nl3]shuts...
[en2]
Hey~,when this boat's
[nl2]a-rockin' don't come
[nl3]a-knockin'!
[en2]
[F2]You put salt water in
[nl2]the water bottle.
[en1]
What's this.. It's a
[nl2]key!! How can we get
[nl3]it out? Hmm, what are[np]
[scl]our items again?
[en2]
[SP$00D3]Okay, now we
[nl2]can pull the key out
[nl3]through his mouth..[np]
[scl]maybe..?
[en1]
[X$79]Aim and pull!
[nl2]   [C$42]       [C$12][X$7E]

[F2]You got the..
[nl2]ンburp!ン cave key...
[nl3]It's a little acidic.
[en1]
Is this the key to the
[nl2]cave?
[en2]
Take this. Use it
[nl2]wisely.

[nl3]You have to find it![np]
[scl]Will you help me?
[scl]    Okay
[scl]    Noooo[X$68]
[en1]
Ooh, what great music!
[nl2]I love to drink while
[nl3]listening to this[np]
[scl]song. Here, you kids
[scl]drink up, too. This

[scl]some hair on your

If you don't hurry up
[nl2]it'll get dark out~

You? I don't think so,
[nl2]Hah!
[en2]
It used to be a cute
[nl2]little plant like
[nl3]this.
[en2]
..It looks like a map.
[nl2]The numbers must be...
[nl3]floor numbers? There[np]
[scl]are two.
[en2]
At first I didn't wish... 
[en2]
There are lots of
[nl2]painful seeming
[nl3]thorns.
[en2]
Don't you have
[nl2]something that would
[nl3]help?
[en2]
Don't you have
[nl2]goosebumps?
[en2]

[nl2] I want to punch it...
[en2]
Haha, I'm glad I
[nl2]secretly brought these
[nl3]swimming goggles with[np]
[scl]me! I'm the only one
[scl]who can enjoy such an
[scl]amazing experience.[np]
[scl]Sorry, but I'm going
[scl]to go diving again
[scl]now...
[en1]
I lost my goggles... I
[nl2]guess I'll just watch
[nl3]them fish...

[nl2] ..My.. My goggles!

[nl2]you want to look at
[nl3]things that are far[np]
[scl]away, you can press

[scl]thing you want to
[scl]check, and then press
[scl][C$02] to check it?
[en2]
I'm so hungry~ Feed
[nl2]me~ Come on, don't
[nl3]just stand there.
[en2]
I'm so hungry~ Feed
[nl2]me~ One more time!
[en2]
[team] Team, are you
[nl2]using [C$48]?
[en2]
I'm so hungry, I think
[nl2]I'll die here.
[en2]
Humming! Humm hum
[nl2]dedum hum hum.
[en2]

[nl2] I'm.. I'm so happy.
[en2]
I'm.. I'm so happy~
[nl2]heheh~
[en2]
Those shoes are pretty
[nl2]good, so try kicking
[nl3]lots of stuff with[np]
[scl]them.
[en2]

[nl2] Want a whiff?
[en2]
If you're boys, why
[nl2]don't you explore the
[nl3]island a little? At[np]
[scl]least get out of here!
[en2]
What does this star
[nl2]mark mean? Is
[nl3]something special[np]
[scl]here?
[en2]
This seems to indicate
[nl2]where we are...
[en2]
Stop whining and go
[nl2]look for it!
[en2]
What? You guys look
[nl2]awfully guilty.. Well,
[nl3]whatever. Until Miss[np]
[scl]Gina gets back, go in
[scl]the tent and listen to
[scl]that egghead's boring[np]
[scl]lecture.
[en1]
Bring the other kids
[nl2]here.
[en2]
You guys aren't
[nl2]seriously going after
[nl3]Miss Gina... are[np]
[scl]you..? ...... .....
[scl]...... Okay, if you
[scl]are, at least take[np]
[scl]these walkie-talkies.
[en1]
When your team is too
[nl2]far to hear your
[nl3]whistle, equip this[np]
[scl]and use the [C$04]
[scl]button.
[en1]
You guys should just
[nl2]call the mainland and
[nl3]wait for adults to[np]
[scl]handle the situation.
[en2]
Kiikii!
[nl2]TL: Are you with
[nl3]them!? You'll never[np]
[scl]take me alive!!
[en1]
Chirpoo
[nl2]TL: Hey, wait!!
[en1]
Winky, are you
[nl2]seriously going to
[nl3]give those keys to[np]
[scl]these kids?
[en1]
Oooki aah!
[nl2]TL: Yes, I believe
[nl3]they are all good[np]
[scl]kids.
[en1]
Mee myuu
[nl2]TL: Fine, come over
[nl3]here and take my coat.
[en2]
Be sure you record
[nl2]everything you've done
[nl3]in the 「Diary.「 If you[np]
[scl]forget and get into a
[scl]mess, don't say I
[scl]didn't warn you.
[en2]
If you look closely,
[nl2]it might be a
[nl3]switch...
[en2]
Maybe if you put fuel
[nl2]in here, the ship will
[nl3]move...
[en2]
It's full of soot.
[nl2]ンcough coughン
[en2]
You only have [X$6B]
[nl2]LR. It isn't enough.
[en2]
You have [X$6B] Luck
[nl2]Rocks!
[en1]
You have [X$6B] Rocks
[nl2]    Put 'em in!
[nl3]    Not just yet.[X$68]
[en1]
Luck Rocks sure are
[nl2]strange stones~
[en2]
It seems like
[nl2]something is hidden
[nl3]beneath this boulder.
[en2]
We've lifted countless
[nl2]boulders already,
[nl3]hohoho...
[en1]
Ick! An ant was under
[nl2]there!
[en1]
Great! There's a hole
[nl2]that leads deeper.
[en1]
Shaka shakaka
[nl2]TL: If you drag your
[nl3]feet, I'll catch you!
[en2]
.....?!
[nl2]I think I can hear a
[nl3]voice from under this[np]
[scl]boulder. Was it my
[scl]imagination?
[en2]

[nl2] ..What the heck?!
[en1]
Oh gosh, what should
[nl2]we do? I wonder if
[nl3]that medicine will[np]
[scl]work on Hassan...
[en2]
Oh man, it won't work
[nl2]on a non-soldier..?
[nl3]Let's use the whole[np]
[scl]bottle!
[en1]
Phew, you saved me. I
[nl2]was about to be
[nl3]squished into a squid![np]
[scl]Thank you so much.
[scl] ...!! Oh no, what
[scl]happened to the[np]
[scl]princess?!
[en1]
Agh, my body won't
[nl2]move... getting old is
[nl3]awful...
[en1]
[F2]Received Hassan's
[nl2]great invention, the
[nl3]buster cannon! I[np]
[scl]wonder how it works.
[en1]
This cannon has 10
[nl2]times the power of the
[nl3]regular Ant Buster and[np]
[scl]should be able to
[scl]defeat the 「Ant
[scl]Queen.「 When you face[np]
[scl]her, press the [C$02]
[scl]button to lock in the
[scl]movement, and use[np]
[scl][C$4A] ... My
[scl]prayers go with you.
[en1]
Shaka shaka!
[nl2]TL: If you want to
[nl3]beat us, you'd better[np]
[scl]bring some ocean
[scl]water!
[en2]
Oh, my tape recorder!
[nl2]Thanks.
[en1]
[F2]You sure are nice
[nl2]children. I'm sure
[nl3]things will start[np]
[scl]going your way.
[en1]
..Now we can't move
[nl2]forward. What do we
[nl3]do?
[en2]
It looks too heavy to
[nl2]move, and if we push
[nl3]it inside.. we still[np]
[scl]can't get in. What
[scl]should we do?
[en2]
Yeah! Now we can keep
[nl2]going! Let's find
[nl3]Polly!
[en1]
It seems there is
[nl2]still a room below.
[en2]
Let's save this until
[nl2]we face the Queen.
[en1]
Let's get closer and
[nl2]check it out.
[en2]
Want to play a fun
[nl2]game? Hehehe. Come a
[nl3]little closer.
[en2]
If you want to play,
[nl2]choose Luck Rock from
[nl3]the [C$4A] menu.
[en2]
Alright, I have taken
[nl2]1 Luck Rock. Look
[nl3]carefully at the[np]
[scl]moving panels before
[scl]you kick!
[en1]
Where were you
[nl2]looking?! You suck so
[nl3]bad! Want to try[np]
[scl]again?
[en1]
Dummy! You're so
[nl2]unlucky. Try again?
[en1]
If you don't
[nl2]concentrate, you can't
[nl3]hit the middle!
[en2]
Oh, you found my 「Kick
[nl2]Slots「 machine. Cool,
[nl3]right?
[en2]
Oh, you found my 「Ball
[nl2]Grabber「 machine.
[nl3]Cool, right?
[en2]
Oh, you found
[nl2]「Defensive Formation「
[nl3]machine. Cool, right?
[en2]

[nl2] Hurry and kick it.
[en2]
When there's only one
[en1]
When there's only [num] Luck Rock
[en1]
Did you run into
[nl2]Hassan? To defeat the
[nl3]Ant Queen, you need[np]
[scl]his Buster Cannon!
[en2]
You have to wait for
[nl2]an opening to use your
[nl3]Buster Cannon. Find[np]
[scl]your courage and aim!
[en2]
Dang... there's
[nl2]nothing to do but wait
[nl3]for death, now.
[en2]
Let's try out that
[nl2]thing Hassan gave us.
[en2]
If you get hit, your
[nl2]controls are reversed
[en2]
[C$08] aim, [C$02] fire
[nl2]   [C$42]       [C$12][X$7E]
[en1]

[nl2] Fire!!!
[en1]

[nl2] Right on! Direct hit!
[en1]
Oh nuts.. we have to
[nl2]aim better!
[en1]
[X$79]Charge up with [C$38][X$78]
[en1]
Yikes, it's coming for
[nl2]us!
[en1]
You guys...
[nl2]
[nl3][np]
[scl]   Thanks....
[en1]
The truth is... I
[nl2]wasn't even tied up.
[nl3]See?
[en1]
I was scared of the
[nl2]queen, but I also
[nl3]believed that you[np]
[scl]would come to my
[scl]rescue... As if!
[scl]Dummies! I'm going[np]
[scl]back to the castle
[scl]now.
[en1]
The monkeys of this
[nl2]island have guarded
[nl3]it's secret[np]
[scl]for generations.[np]
[scl]Today, this
[scl]responsibility is
[scl]passed on to you.
[en1]
[F2]Winky received
[nl2]「Three keys「
[nl3]from the elder.
[en1]
Have you seen the
[nl2]ancient ship on this
[nl3]island? That ship and[np]
[scl]these keys have a
[scl]strong connection...
[en1]
These keys unlock the
[nl2]secret of this island.
[nl3]But more than that,[np]
[scl]they have the power to
[scl]change the lives of
[scl]those who hold them.[np]
[scl]Winky, you must find
[scl]humans who are worthy
[scl]of the keys.
[en1]
Ah yes, Piroc? Are you
[nl2]here, Piroc?
[en1]
Piroc will aid you in
[nl2]your task. You two
[nl3]must work together to[np]
[scl]protect the keys.
[en1]
Ooh aaah!
[nl2]TL: Bad news, Elder!
[nl3]Humans have come to[np]
[scl]capture us!
[en1]
You must escape,
[nl2]Elder!
[en1]
Ooh aah ooh!
[nl2]TL: They've come for
[nl3]the keys! Winky,[np]
[scl]Piroc, I'm counting on
[scl]you!
[en1]
Chirpy chirp-chirp!
[nl2]TL: What are you doing?[np]
[nl3]Hurry, you need
[scl]to get out of
[scl]here, too![np]
[scl]Gosh, what a
[scl]dunce.
[en1]
Did the country really
[nl2]return to its previous
[nl3]size? That's a lot to[np]
[scl]swallow...
[en2]
This country returned
[nl2]to normal size, right?
[nl3]I'm going to go check[np]
[scl]it out.
[en1]
Come over here, I have
[nl2]something to tell
[nl3]you...
[en2]
Thanks to you guys, I
[nl2]saw something cool!
[nl3]Here's a secret prize.
[en1]
[F2]You received Luck
[nl2]Rocks from the king!
[nl3]He gave you.. [C$28][C$1E][np]
[scl]pieces!! Wow!
[en1]
Can you go see Polly
[nl2]before you leave? She
[nl3]puts on a tough act,[np]
[scl]but she is actually
[scl]lonely on the inside.
[en2]
Polly doesn't really
[nl2]take after her mom...
[nl3]Maybe this is what it[np]
[scl]means to be an adult?
[en2]
The king told me I
[nl2]have to draw Polly
[nl3]next, but without a[np]
[scl]model, I can't do it.
[en2]
Perfect! You've
[nl2]mastered my [F2]
[nl3]drawing technique!
[en2]
Customers stopped
[nl2]coming around thanks
[nl3]to those 「Blue Things「[np]
[scl]ant monsters, so
[scl]business is in the
[scl]pits.
[en2]
Oh, if you stay in an
[nl2]inn, when you start
[nl3]the game, choose[np]
[scl]「start from inn.「 You
[scl]can't stay in an inn
[scl]while you're playing.
[en2]
I have something to
[nl2]tell you, so come
[nl3]closer!
[en2]
Thank you so much!!
[nl2]Now the kingdom can
[nl3]become a happy place[np]
[scl]again.
[scl]Oh, leaving already?
[scl]Did you talk to Polly?[np]
[scl]I haven't seen her
[scl]lately...
[scl]You're welcome to[np]
[scl]return whenever you
[scl]like.
[en2]
It looks like a bug
[nl2]carrying a round
[nl3]thing. Is that round[np]
[scl]thing an eagle egg?
[en2]
Two small bugs are
[nl2]rolling an egg.
[en2]
Shaka shaka.
[nl2]TL: Just when we got
[nl3]rid of that eagle,[np]
[scl]it's too heavy and we
[scl]can't move it.
[en2]
Shaka shaka
[nl2]TL: We're eggroll-ers.
[nl3]If we stopped rolling,[np]
[scl]we'd be just plain old
[scl]bugs.
[en2]
So these guys were the
[nl2]thieves. Oh, we can
[nl3]replace that ball with[np]
[scl]this egg! Watch the
[scl]movements carefully
[scl]and press [C$02] to take[np]
[scl]the egg. Press [C$04] to
[scl]cancel.
[en1]
[SP$0127]
[nl2]Take these 3 keys.
[en1]
Crap, they're moving
[nl2]too much!
[en1]
[F2]You received the
[nl2]real eagle egg! Let's
[nl3]exchange it for the[np]
[scl]ball.
[en1]
Polly has requested
[nl2]your presence at the
[nl3]castle. It must be for[np]
[scl]some kind of 「reward.「
[en2]
Your battle with the
[nl2]「Queen「 will be told
[nl3]in stories for[np]
[scl]generations.
[en2]
Everyone's waiting for
[nl2]you at the castle.
[nl3]Hurry up and see them.
[en2]
Regrettably, there are
[nl2]still some who have
[nl3]not returned from the[np]
[scl]「Blue Things「 nest.
[scl]Could they not have
[scl]been saved?
[en2]
At least now, the
[nl2]「Blue Things「 will
[nl3]stop attacking this[np]
[scl]country. Now, if the
[scl]monsters in the forest
[scl]would shrink a[np]
[scl]little...
[en2]
But we can't let our
[nl2]guard down yet. There
[nl3]are still giant[np]
[scl]monsters out there.
[scl]Stay frosty.
[en2]
The Blue Things'
[nl2]「Queen「 was defeated,
[nl3]but there are still[np]
[scl]giant monsters in the
[scl]forest. We must be
[scl]careful.
[en2]
You guys might get a
[nl2]nice salary out of
[nl3]this.
[en2]
I should have spent
[nl2]more time honing my
[nl3]battle skills, though[np]
[scl]it's too late for that
[scl]now.
[en2]
I just heard from Lady
[nl2]Polly... It's a pretty
[nl3]good name, I guess.
[en2]
Thank you for saving
[nl2]all the soldiers.
[nl3]Everyone is very[np]
[scl]grateful to you.
[en2]
Well, not every
[nl2]soldier made it back,
[nl3]but in that situation[np]
[scl]I guess it was
[scl]impossible.. Pray for
[scl]their souls.
[en2]
The king is waiting
[nl2]for you. Hurry and see
[nl3]him.
[en2]
I think I'll name my
[nl2]army [team] army.
[nl3]Yeah, that sounds[np]
[scl]good.
[en2]
I shudder to remember
[nl2]how I thought I would
[nl3]die in that dark,[np]
[scl]terrible place.
[en2]
Hassan requested that
[nl2]I give you gifts to
[nl3]your heart's content.
[en2]
I bet Polly thinks
[nl2]much better of you
[nl3]now. Why don't you go[np]
[scl]see her?
[en2]
The king is also very
[nl2]pleased. Go see him.
[en2]
Come with me, the king
[nl2]is waiting for you
[nl3]behind the castle.
[en1]
As thanks for saving
[nl2]Polly, you may enter
[nl3]my secret garden. What[np]
[scl]do you think? I tried
[scl]to combine East and
[scl]West in this rock[np]
[scl]garden.
[en2]
Hmm? This garden? It's
[nl2]my first time seeing
[nl3]it as well, but[np]
[scl]doesn't the ball in
[scl]the middle give you
[scl]the willies?
[en2]
Caesar said you kids
[nl2]did a good job, and
[nl3]not to forget how to[np]
[scl]paint.
[en2]
Could it be.. is it
[nl2]possible!? We need to
[nl3]talk to Hassan.
[en2]
You wish to consult
[nl2]with me? Then come
[nl3]closer.
[en2]
..Yes, it's
[nl2]possible... yes, that
[nl3]explains everything..[np]
[scl]I see, it's making us
[scl]dwarves! And .. that
[scl]ball is the cause of[np]
[scl]everything! Wait here
[scl]a moment.
[en1]
Actually.. how do I
[nl2]say this... the king
[nl3]has stated that you[np]
[scl]boys may take the ball
[scl]as your prize. It
[scl]might seem like it's[np]
[scl]for our convenience,
[scl]but please help us get
[scl]rid of it.
[en1]
That ball was found in
[nl2]the forest before this
[nl3]kingdom shrank. It[np]
[scl]wasn't always that
[scl]big, come to think of
[scl]it.
[en2]
We could float it into
[nl2]the sky and let the
[nl3]wind carry it! ....[np]
[scl]psyche! Something that
[scl]heavy won't float.
[en2]

[nl2]I wonder how that
[nl3]happened...
[en2]
What if you lifted it
[nl2]with teamwork? But the
[nl3]ship is awfully far,[np]
[scl]isn't it...
[en2]
We have to do
[nl2]something right away!
[en2]
That's right! The
[nl2]giant eagle that
[nl3]attacked us was[np]
[scl]looking for an egg!
[scl]If we painted this
[scl]ball the same pattern[np]
[scl]as an egg... maybe
[scl]the eagle would take
[scl]it away for us![np]
[scl]Will you try it?
[scl]    Yeah, we will.
[scl]    I can't remember. [X$68]
[en1]
You need to go to the
[nl2]eagle's nest and look
[nl3]at his eggs! Hurry!
[en1]
Now let's go back to
[nl2]the ball and paint it
[nl3]like the eggs!
[en2]
Let's get close and
[nl2]give it a try.
[en2]
I wonder if this will
[nl2]work... won't hurt to
[nl3]try.
[en2]
Are you ready? I'm not
[nl2]sure if this will
[nl3]work, but it's our[np]
[scl]best shot.[np]
[scl][X$6A]    We'll try it.
[scl]    I can't remember.[X$68]
[en1]
[SP$00D3]Let's start. Remember
[nl2]Caesar's books. What
[nl3]color is first?[np]
[scl][X$6A]    Deon red
[scl]    Jack blue
[scl]    Max green[X$6E]
[en1]
Who is next?
[nl2]    Deon red
[nl3]    Jack blue[X$68]
[en1]
Who is next?
[nl2]    Deon red
[nl3]    Max green[X$68]
[en1]
Who is next?
[nl2]    Jack blue
[nl3]    Max green[X$68]
[en1]
It seems like the
[nl2]eagle won't come.
[nl3]Maybe the pattern is[np]
[scl]wrong? Why don't you
[scl]go look at the eggs
[scl]again.
[en1]
Maybe you should read
[nl2]Caesar's book 「How to
[nl3]Paint「 in the[np]
[scl]archives.
[en2]
[SP$0319]What's
[nl2]wrong? Just calm down,
[nl3]focus, and look at the[np]
[scl]egg. Okay?
[en1]
[SP$0119]Caww caw!
[nl2]TL: I found it! My
[nl3]egg!!
[en1]
[SP$0119]Caw! cawcaw!
[nl2]TL: My poor little
[nl3]egg! Let's go home~
[en1]
Hurray! The eagle took
[nl2]the ball away! Hurry
[nl3]to the nest and take[np]
[scl]it back!
[en1]
Oh, right, no one is
[nl2]allowed to use the
[nl3]electric switch[np]
[scl]anymore. It seems
[scl]broken.
[en2]
Hey, this game is only
[nl2]for someone who knows
[nl3]how to kick.
[en2]
Huh? You don't have
[nl2]any Luck Rocks left,
[nl3]chump. ... Fine, I'll[np]
[scl]take pity on you and
[scl]give you [num] Luck
[scl]Rock. You should quit[np]
[scl]while you're ahead.
[en1]
Received [num] Luck Rock
[nl2]from Jam. Jam might be
[nl3]nicer than Jim!
[en1]
Okay, you got lucky
[nl2]that time. Try again?
[nl3]Don't run out on me,[np]
[scl]now.
[en1]
[X$6A]Received [X$6B] Luck Rocks.
[en1]
Listen to Winky. He's
[nl2]not very useful, but
[nl3]this time his[np]
[scl]instincts seem spot
[scl]on.
[en2]
Ooh ooh!
[nl2]TL: Make Indio and his
[nl3]daughter happy. Be[np]
[scl]careful! Bye-bye.
[en2]
Ooh ooh aah!
[nl2]TL: Find the man in
[nl3]charge on the island.[np]
[scl]He's somewhere
[scl]cramped. Poor guy.
[en2]
Ooh ooh aah!
[nl2]TL: The little king is
[nl3]in distress. Tell him[np]
[scl]why he is so small.
[en2]
Ooh ooh!
[nl2]TL:
[en2]

[nl2] Which one? Show me!
[en2]
Great, let's go find
[nl2]the last [C$22] crystal
[nl3]balls. After the ship[np]
[scl]leaves you won't be
[scl]able to return to this
[scl]island, so make sure[np]
[scl]you've done everything
[scl]you want to do here.
[scl]When you're ready,[np]
[scl]start her up!
[en2]
Great, let's go find
[nl2]the last crystal ball.
[nl3]Do you have enough[np]
[scl]Luck Rocks? You can
[scl]take it from here.
[en2]
Okay, now everything
[nl2]is in order. Let's
[nl3]head back to the[np]
[scl]island!
[scl] ...........?!
[en2]

[nl2] Hurry and show Piroc!
[en2]
We've arrived at an
[nl2]island!
[en1]
Oooh eee!
[nl2]TL: Move the ship and
[nl3]save teacher! Hurry![np]
[scl]Hurry!
[en1]
[SP$033A]Chirp!
[nl2]TL: Come on, Winky,
[nl3]you have to explain[np]
[scl]from the beginning.
[en1]
Actually, you can't
[nl2]open the door with
[nl3]just the crystal ball[np]
[scl]you have.
[en1]
In order to open the
[nl2]door, you need [C$24]
[nl3]more crystal. Don't[np]
[scl]blame me, that's
[scl]Captain Maverick's
[scl]first puzzle! Use this[np]
[scl]ship to track down the
[scl]other [C$24] balls.
[scl]That's the only way to[np]
[scl]save your teacher.
[scl]Otherwise, you'll end
[scl]up like those pirates.[np]
[scl]So, how about it? Will
[scl]you look for the other
[scl]crystal balls?[np]
[scl]    Yes
[scl]    No[X$68]
[en1]
Don't you understand
[nl2]anything? Seriously,
[nl3]it's like there are 4[np]
[scl]Winkys here.
[en1]
I'll borrow the
[nl2]crystal ball. It
[nl3]should show the[np]
[scl]position of the next
[scl]crystal, like a
[scl]compass.
[en1]
Next, you need to put
[nl2][X$6B] Luck Rocks in
[nl3]the furnace below[np]
[scl]decks. Then pull the
[scl]giant lever.
[en2]
It looks like you've
[nl2]filled the furnace
[nl3]below decks. Now, pull[np]
[scl]the lever.
[en2]
After you put in the
[nl2]Luck Rocks, pull the
[nl3]lever.
[en2]
Fill furnace down
[nl2]stairs. Hurry! Hurry!
[en2]
After you get the ship
[nl2]moving, you have to
[nl3]come here and hold the[np]
[scl]wheel steady.
[scl]Otherwise, we'll never
[scl]reach the next island.
[en2]
We're all in this
[nl2]together, friends,
[nl3]friends.
[en2]

[nl2] Hold her steady!
[en2]
Why don't you go relax
[nl2]outside until we reach
[nl3]the next island?
[en2]
Do you know what's
[nl2]next? Excited~
[en2]
The ship is listing
[nl2]out of control! You
[nl3]need to lock the[np]
[scl]course in when it is
[scl]heading straight
[scl]ahead.
[en2]
[X$79] Lock on
[nl2]        [C$12][X$7E]
[en1]
The island with the
[nl2]next crystal ball must
[nl3]be this way.
[en2]

[nl2] It's locked on.
[en2]
It looks like we can
[nl2]just barely reach it.
[en2]

[nl2] Pull the lever!
[en2]
Do it together! hurry!
[nl2]hurry!
[en2]
[SP$0119]Kweh!
[nl2]TL: I'll never leave
[nl3]my eggs again!
[en2]

[nl2] This is a real egg...
[en1]
[SP$0119]Kweh?!
[nl2]TL: What's going on?
[nl3].. there are 4 eggs?
[en1]
[SP$0119]Kweh!!
[nl2]TL: This one isn't
[nl3]mine!!
[en1]
[SP$0119]Kweh!
[nl2]TL: Wow, that almost
[nl3]fooled me.  I'm taking[np]
[scl]my egg back!
[en1]
[SP$0119]Kweh~
[nl2]TL: Stay away from my
[nl3]eggs.
[en2]
Let's get back to the
[nl2]ship right away.
[en2]
What are you doing?
[nl2]Hurry up and get over
[nl3]here.
[en2]
Did you put the Luck
[nl2]Rocks in the furnace?
[nl3]If you need more,[np]
[scl]I'll give you mine.
[scl]    Yes, please.
[scl]    Don't need you![X$68]
[en1]
Well fine, then go
[nl2]below decks and
[nl3]prepare for departure![np]
[scl] .. Imbecile!
[en2]
You guys have [X$6C]
[nl2]Luck Rocks, so you
[nl3]need [X$6B] more.[np]
[scl]Here you are.
[en1]
Received [X$6B] Luck
[nl2]Rocks from Polly!
[en1]
You guys are lazy
[nl2]pigs! Hurry up and get
[nl3]down below!
[en1]
Did you already fill
[nl2]the furnace? Hurry up
[nl3]if you haven't, you[np]
[scl]don't have any time to
[scl]waste, do you?
[en2]
[SP$0017]
[nl2]... Just kidding. I'm
[nl3]not going. I really[np]
[scl]want to go with you
[scl]all, but I can't leave
[scl]my father alone. My[np]
[scl]journey ends here...
[en1]
Ooh aah!
[nl2]TL: That girl was a
[nl3]little scary...
[en2]
Chirpy chirp
[nl2]TL: I wonder if she
[nl3]still wants to travel[np]
[scl]with us.
[en2]
There are two polka
[nl2]dot eggs. It looks
[nl3]like another egg would[np]
[scl]fit in the nest.
[en2]
I wonder if whoever
[nl2]sailed this ship ran
[nl3]it alone?
[en2]
It looks like it would
[nl2]take a lot of power to
[nl3]move this...
[en2]
This ship's captain
[nl2]sat here, I guess.
[en2]
Those guys who
[nl2]kidnapped Miss Gina
[nl3]might know.
[en2]
Alright, let's flip
[nl2]this one.
[en1]
Chirp chirpy!
[nl2]TL: Your timing was
[nl3]off! Lock it when it[np]
[scl]changes color, ya
[scl]deadweight!
[en1]
Chirpy chirpy
[nl2]TL: Good job! Now we
[nl3]can go to the next[np]
[scl]island!
[en1]
The island I just came
[nl2]from was crazy! They
[nl3]were having some[np]
[scl]horrible drought, the
[scl]people and fields were
[scl]just dry as dust. It[np]
[scl]used to be such a nice
[scl]place... oh, I've
[scl]talked your ears right[np]
[scl]off. Toodleloo~!
[en1]
I hear a lot of my
[nl2]friends out there...
[en2]

[nl2] Something is coming..
[en2]
[SP$0119]Caww!
[nl2]TL: A storm's brewin'!
[nl3]Take shelter!
[en2]
Look outside! You have
[nl2]to lock the wheel
[nl3]before we're swept[np]
[scl]away!
[en2]
The lock was broken!
[nl2]Fix it! Fix it!
[en2]

[nl2] It's not even winter.
[en2]

[nl2] Cold! Cold!
[en2]
It has to be a little
[nl2]cold!
[en2]
Excuse me? You'll set
[nl2]me up with a girl who
[nl3]can 「show me a good[np]
[scl]time「?! I'm married,
[scl]you know!
[en2]

[nl2] Do something!!
[en2]
Something is blocking
[nl2]our path!
[en2]
Maybe this is blocking
[nl2]our path?
[en2]
Ooh ooh!
[nl2]TL: Come here! Fast!
[en2]
We're searching this
[nl2]island for some lost
[nl3]kids! Do you know[np]
[scl]anything about them?
[scl]They were called
[scl][team] Team, and one[np]
[scl]of them had that
[scl]hat... hey, you kids
[scl]aren't..?
[en2]
We're back at the
[nl2]first island.
[en2]
[SP$0010].. I wonder
[nl2]how Polly is doing.
[en2]
It seems like Polly
[nl2]might jump out at any
[nl3]moment...
[en2]
This robot and this
[nl2]whole island are
[nl3]pretty strange. I have[np]
[scl]a weird feeling. And
[scl]we can't find those
[scl]missing kids.
[en2]
It seems like stuff
[nl2]went to pot after we
[nl3]left.
[en2]
..There's no response.
[nl2]It must be broken.
[en2]
It seems like someone
[nl2]was growing tomatoes
[nl3]here. I wonder if it's[np]
[scl]connected to this case
[scl]somehow.
[en2]
There's a path through
[nl2]here. It seems to lead
[nl3]to the opposite side[np]
[scl]of the island, but
[scl]it's a pretty old
[scl]road.
[en2]
The pipe is connected
[nl2]to the lake up
[nl3]there... when we came[np]
[scl]here, all the pipes
[scl]were connected so the
[scl]lake water would run[np]
[scl]down to the ocean. Why
[scl]would someone do that?
[en2]
If you understand,
[nl2]then don't get in the
[nl3]way of a man at work.
[en2]
This whole thing must
[nl2]be Blue's doing. His
[nl3]cohorts are keeping[np]
[scl]their mouths shut,
[scl]though.
[en2]
If you want to go
[nl2]through here, you need
[nl3]the colonel's[np]
[scl]permission.
[en2]
Hurry up and put
[nl2][X$6B] Luck Rocks in
[nl3]the furnace below!!
[en2]
Hurry and save Miss
[nl2]Gina!
[en2]
Push the lever! We
[nl2]have to save Miss
[nl3]Gina!
[en2]
We can handle things
[nl2]until we reach the
[nl3]island. Why don't you[np]
[scl]go outside and get
[scl]some fresh air, [team]
[scl]Team?
[en2]
We can handle things
[nl2]until the next island!
[en2]
[team] Team, pull the
[nl2]lever!!
[en2]

[nl2]    Team work!
[en2]
And Piroc is on this
[nl2]ship, isn't he? Tell
[nl3]him I'll visit him[np]
[scl]again sometime. Bye!
[en1]
Hurry and push the
[nl2]lever!
[en2]
Fugo fugogo.
[nl2]TL: If you have
[nl3]something to say, come[np]
[scl]a little closer. I
[scl]won't bite....
[en2]
..Hey, wasn't our
[nl2]teacher with you? ...
[nl3]Who? Miss Gina, duh!![np]
[scl]Don't make me say lame
[scl]stuff like that!
[en2]
By the way, what
[nl2]happened to Miss Gina?
[nl3]Wasn't she with you?[np]
[scl].... Is she really
[scl]lost?!
[en2]
Oh, you guys are okay.
[nl2]But what about Miss
[nl3]Gina? Wasn't she with[np]
[scl]you? You want to go in
[scl]the cave ahead? No
[scl]way, it's dangerous in[np]
[scl]there. I can't let
[scl]some kids in there.
[en2]
By the way, what
[nl2]happened to Miss Gina?
[nl3]Wasn't she with you?[np]
[scl]... She's really
[scl]missing? .. You want
[scl]permission from the[np]
[scl]Colonel to enter the
[scl]cave? .. What on
[scl]earth? What's in the[np]
[scl]cave? You can't tell
[scl]me? ... Okay, just
[scl]give me a minute.
[en1]
Get close and give it
[nl2]a good look.
[en2]
Here you go, the
[nl2]colonel's permission
[nl3]slip. ... I can't go[np]
[scl]with you? Are you kids
[scl]really going to be
[scl]okay on your own? ..[np]
[scl]Okay then, here you
[scl]go.
[en1]
Pretty good, right? If
[nl2]you get busted, just
[nl3]run away, okay?
[en1]
[F2]Received the
[nl2]colonel's permission
[nl3]slip. This teacher[np]
[scl]is.. a little
[scl]insubordinate?
[en1]
You don't know
[nl2]anything about your
[nl3]teacher's whereabouts?[np]
[scl]Nothing at all...? You
[scl]should tell me
[scl]anything you know.
[en2]
I get the sense you
[nl2]boys have an important
[nl3]task. I don't know[np]
[scl]what it is, but give
[scl]it your all!
[en2]
Myuu! Minoo
[nl2]TL: I .. HATE.. you!!!
[nl3]I'd give my coat to[np]
[scl]anyone else!!
[en2]
Umm.. it might be
[nl2]broken?
[en2]
Look at the door
[nl2]behind you. That is
[nl3]the only way out of[np]
[scl]here. You can't go
[scl]back now. What will
[scl]you do?[np]
[scl] -Captain Maverick
[en1]
[X$6A]Good luck you
[nl2]guys! Miss Gina is in
[nl3]your hands now!
[en1]
The door is closed for
[nl2]all eternity. There is
[nl3]no way out for you.
[en2]
Look around the
[nl2]village. There should
[nl3]be a clue leading to[np]
[scl]the crystal ball!
[en1]
Why don't you show
[nl2]those documents to
[nl3]someone who knows a[np]
[scl]lot about plants?
[scl]Here.... 
[scl] aren't I a nice guy?
[en1]
You know, withholding
[nl2]documents is very
[nl3]suspicious!
[en1]
The village manager
[nl2]doesn't meet anyone
[nl3]without an appointment[np]
[scl]by phone. If you place
[scl]that wood splinter
[scl]back into the sign,[np]
[scl]you should be able to
[scl]figure out the phone
[scl]number.
[en1]
Hurry and get back to
[nl2]the ship! But if you
[nl3]want more Luck Rocks,[np]
[scl]look for the monkeys
[scl]on the island. Good
[scl]luck!
[en1]
If the grass is
[nl2]blocking your path,
[nl3]kick it out of the[np]
[scl]way!
[en1]
I'll let you in on a
[nl2]secret. Everything has
[nl3]a weak point. Look[np]
[scl]closely at moving
[scl]things.
[en1]
Hurry back to the
[nl2]village! Prof. Marlowe
[nl3]has made a discovery!
[en1]
Why don't you try
[nl2]spraying various
[nl3]things?
[en1]
What's going on? Let's
[nl2]try asking Mr. Smith!
[en1]
Did you try recording
[nl2]a mouse's squeak and
[nl3]playing it for one of[np]
[scl]the villagers? You
[scl]might find out who
[scl]Mike is that way!
[en1]
The guy you met
[nl2]outside the cave was
[nl3]looking for you!
[en1]
Did you talk to all
[nl2]the villagers? Don't
[nl3]forget to check lots[np]
[scl]of things with the [C$02]
[scl]button, too~!
[en1]
Instead of eating the
[nl2]meal yourselves, what
[nl3]if you tried to give[np]
[scl]it to someone else? It
[scl]seems spicy, so
[scl]they'll probably need[np]
[scl]water afterward. Come
[scl]to think of it, wasn't
[scl]there water[np]
[scl]underground by the
[scl]cacti? But it seemed
[scl]awfully salty!
[en1]
Wow, stuff is getting
[nl2]out of control! After
[nl3]spraying the parasite[np]
[scl]with salt water, you
[scl]can try punching it
[scl]with Max. If Max[np]
[scl]doesn't have boxing
[scl]gloves, you need to
[scl]find some!
[en1]
Oh no, did you look at
[nl2]the X-Ray? Jack, do
[nl3]something!
[en1]
Did you meet the small
[nl2]people who were
[nl3]attacked by an eagle?[np]
[scl]I suspect they may be
[scl]related to Polly
[scl]somehow!
[en1]
It seems the people of
[nl2]this island are being
[nl3]assaulted by giant[np]
[scl]bugs and animals. How
[scl]did they get so big?
[en1]
Boy, what a handful.
[nl2]We have to collect 5
[nl3]objects.. for now,[np]
[scl]let's choose one of
[scl]the following 3: 
[scl]Frog tail ・ shell[np]
[scl]Gold drop ・ coat
[scl]Silver thread ・
[scl]painting tools[X$6E]
[en1]
Frogs don't actually
[nl2]have tails, but the
[nl3]frog in the forest[np]
[scl]cherishes his. If you
[scl]listen to his problem
[scl]and follow the power[np]
[scl]cable back to the
[scl]castle, you should
[scl]find a way to solve it[np]
[scl]and convince him to
[scl]give you his treasure.
[scl]As far as the Forest[np]
[scl]Shell, that's a snail
[scl]shell. This is the
[scl]season snails like to[np]
[scl]change their homes.
[scl]Answer the roly poly
[scl]bug's questions[np]
[scl]correctly, and then
[scl]find a house a snail
[scl]might like in the[np]
[scl]city.
[en1]
The 「Golden Drop「
[nl2]refers to honey. There
[nl3]are 3 bees in the[np]
[scl]forest, and one of
[scl]them is easily
[scl]startled. You can[np]
[scl]scare him to get a
[scl]drop, but you need to
[scl]see where it falls and[np]
[scl]remember the location.
[scl]The Forest Coat is a
[scl]coccoon's shell. The[np]
[scl]cocoons in this forest
[scl]are very fashionable
[scl]and will throw away[np]
[scl]their coat if it gets
[scl]dirty. You should have
[scl]an item for that,[np]
[scl]right?
[en1]

[nl2]Try each of your
[nl3]favorite skills.
[en1]

[nl2]Maybe if you try
[nl3]a different[np]
[scl]approach.
[en1]
You've done a lot of
[nl2]things, but there's no
[nl3]trace of the crystal[np]
[scl]ball. Maybe you should
[scl]talk to Solomon.
[en1]
Oh no, it's awful.
[nl2]Polly is being held in
[nl3]the lowest level of[np]
[scl]the ant hill. You'll
[scl]have to find holes in
[scl]the ground to go to[np]
[scl]the lower levels. Be
[scl]careful of ants!
[en1]
Did you help the
[nl2]injured soldiers?
[nl3]Search the area near[np]
[scl]the soldiers. Don't
[scl]you have a tool that
[scl]can dig holes?
[en1]
The little boy in town
[nl2]might know how to
[nl3]defeat a giant toy[np]
[scl]robot. Your opening is
[scl]when he turns to the
[scl]side.
[en1]
You have to find the
[nl2]holes leading down
[nl3]that the ants covered[np]
[scl]up. Think back on your
[scl]journey and you should
[scl]realize how to find[np]
[scl]the holes.
[en1]
You can't defeat the
[nl2]queen without a strong
[nl3]weapon from Hassan.[np]
[scl]Did you already
[scl]receive it?
[en1]
It's time to wrap this
[nl2]up. You need the eagle
[nl3]to carry the treasure[np]
[scl]away from the castle's
[scl]secret garden. Do you
[scl]remember what the[np]
[scl]eagle egg looks like?
[scl]Think back to what you
[scl]learned at Caesar's[np]
[scl]house and remember the
[scl]painting order.
[en1]
What are you doing?
[nl2]You've saved Polly's
[nl3]kingdom, but you don't[np]
[scl]have the crystal ball
[scl]yet. Find the real
[scl]eagle egg and take it[np]
[scl]to the eagle.
[en1]
Hurry up and take the
[nl2]egg to the eagle. If
[nl3]you do, I'm sure he'll[np]
[scl]give you the crystal
[scl]ball.
[en1]
There's nothing left
[nl2]to do on this island.
[nl3]Let's hurry up and get[np]
[scl]to the ship. We need
[scl]to continue our
[scl]journey.
[en1]
Piroc! What happened
[nl2]to Piroc?! He's never
[nl3]here when you need[np]
[scl]him. Piroc!!
[en1]
Piroc, you have a lot
[nl2]of Luck Rocks, don't
[nl3]you?
[en1]
Elder!? How could you
[nl2]even suggest... I
[nl3]don't know anything[np]
[scl]about that!
[en1]
You fool! Do you think
[nl2]I'm blind?! You
[nl3]rascal! Even if you[np]
[scl]have them, they won't
[scl]do anything for you.
[scl]Use them so the humans[np]
[scl]can get safely home,
[scl]or else!!
[en1]
.. Fine! Darn, I can't
[nl2]lie to the elder. I
[nl3]get it, we're going[np]
[scl]now.
[en1]
You're going to go
[nl2]fire up the engine?
[nl3]Leave it to us! Let's[np]
[scl]go, Jim.
[en1]
It takes 3 of you?
[nl2]Don't worry, I'm at
[nl3]least as strong as two[np]
[scl]of you.
[en1]
Miss Gina!! Leave it
[nl2]to me! Let's go, Jim!
[en1]
Arnold oughtta be
[nl2]ashamed of himself,
[nl3]acting like that at[np]
[scl]his age. He must be in
[scl]「L「 with Miss Gina.
[en1]

[nl2] Jim, get down here!!!
[en1]
Now we must say our
[nl2]farewells. Winky, come
[nl3]off the ship!
[en1]
What, you got
[nl2]something to say? From
[nl3]now on, I'm the main[np]
[scl]character! Get ready
[scl]for King Blue's story!
[en1]
Hey, why is it getting
[nl2]smaller!? Stop it!
[nl3]Don't just end on me!!
[en1]
Dangit, I'll remember
[nl2]this!!
[en1]

[nl2] ..That's fishy.
[en2]
Well isn't that quite
[nl2]an item![np]
[scl]    Okay.
[scl]    Nevermind.[X$68]
[en1]
What? Then show me
[nl2]something else.
[en2]

[nl2]Good job! Anything
[nl3]is possible through[np]
[scl]diplomatic channels.
[en1]
Is that weirder than
[nl2]my mom's hairstyle?
[en2]
Could that person
[nl2]be... no, it couldn't
[nl3]be. Forget I said[np]
[scl]anything.
[en2]
Our dad is cool, isn't
[nl2]he?
[en2]

[nl2] Captain, forgive me!
[en2]
Benson, take care of
[nl2]these children,
[nl3]please!!
[en2]

[nl2] Look at our boy!
[en1]
Don't forget that Miss
[nl2]Gina said all 3 of us
[nl3]have to stay together!
[en2]
Come closer and show
[nl2]it to me!
[en2]
You've disgraced our
[nl2]royal family. You kids
[nl3]must face your[np]
[scl]punishment!
[en2]
It's a picture of
[nl2]Polly's dad, the king.
[en2]
Let's get close and
[nl2]check it out.
[en2]
This toy robot is
[nl2]enormous...
[en2]
Teamwork takes all 3
[nl2]of us!
[en2]
They look impossible
[nl2]to move...
[en2]
If my dog eats
[nl2]anything, he falls
[nl3]straight asleep!
[en1]

[nl2] Not!
[en2]
Is he alive..? Let's
[nl2]get closer and check.
[en2]
.. it's a tomato.
[nl2]That's a relief.
[en2]
Let's get closer and
[nl2]read it.
[en2]
Let's give it a closer
[nl2]look.
[en2]
It's a strangely
[nl2]circular egg.
[en2]
By the way.. do you
[nl2]remember me?
[en2]

[nl2] Hey, broo!
[en2]
[X$6A][SP$020D]You don't have items
[en2]
Did you open the blue
[nl2]chest? If you use what
[nl3]came out of it from[np]
[scl][C$4A], you can
[scl]control the robot!
[en1]
Push the 4 switches
[nl2]inside the cave with
[nl3][C$48]! Make the[np]
[scl]strongest boy the
[scl]leader.
[en1]

[nl3]You know what I think?
[en1]
You can use the rope
[nl2]with [C$4A]. Use it
[nl3]near the pushable[np]
[scl]boulder!
[en1]

[nl3]You can't ride it[np]
[scl]from there~!
[en1]
You're an
[nl2]embarrassment, Max.
[en2]
Did you go inside the
[nl2]mansion? There are a
[nl3]lot of clocks inside,[np]
[scl]right? According to
[scl]Indio's memo, set it
[scl]to 9:30 and then[np]
[scl]10:30.
[en1]
Maybe the person who
[nl2]came out of the clock
[nl3]was the man in the[np]
[scl]photograph? Which
[scl]means, that room must
[scl]be a time room! If you[np]
[scl]look around in there,
[scl]maybe you can find the
[scl]time machine! The[np]
[scl]purple clock looks
[scl]pretty suspicious.
[en1]
Find the man from the
[nl2]lake and show him the
[nl3]penguin! He might be[np]
[scl]happy enough to give
[scl]you a gift.
[en1]
Did you listen to
[nl2]Indio? I'm sure he'll
[nl3]be surprised if you[np]
[scl]show him what you
[scl]found at the cemetery.
[en1]
Did you show Benson
[nl2]the picture? I'm sure
[nl3]that will make him[np]
[scl]believe you.
[en1]
Benson knows all about
[nl2]the Mammoth Brothers,
[nl3]so why don't you ask[np]
[scl]him to show you
[scl]around?
[en1]
Check for Benson's
[nl2]sign with the
[nl3]telescope in the[np]
[scl]bandit hideout. Head
[scl]whichever direction
[scl]his sign is. Be sure[np]
[scl]to use teamwork.
[en1]
Speaking of Luck
[nl2]Rocks, do you have a
[nl3]good stash? You'll[np]
[scl]need a lot to defeat
[scl]the bandits.
[en1]
Check out the Mammoth
[nl2]Brothers with the [C$02]
[nl3]button!
[en1]
Benson's final words
[nl2]must be hidden
[nl3]somewhere in the[np]
[scl]village! If you follow
[scl]his instructions,
[scl]you'll receive the[np]
[scl]crystal ball.
[en1]
Try talking to the man
[nl2]near the gorilla.
[en1]
There's a place to
[nl2]peek into John's
[nl3]house. Did you find[np]
[scl]it? Everyone has
[scl]secrets!
[en1]
Are you stuck in the
[nl2]cave with the mice?
[nl3]Try catching the daddy[np]
[scl]mouse with your
[scl]fishing rod and then
[scl]pull gently.
[en1]
The crystal ball is in
[nl2]the underground cave!
[nl3]Hurry and get it!
[en1]
Don't forget to give
[nl2]Hassan the items you
[nl3]find in the forest!
[en1]

[nl2] You should dig here.
[en2]
This is too lame. Only
[nl2]old people like swing!
[en2]
Gramps might be happy
[nl2]to hear this...
[en2]
Find Hassan. He is in
[nl2]the ant colony
[nl3]somewhere. Maybe under[np]
[scl]a boulder.
[en1]
Noses, bird legs, ant
[nl2]legs, spider legs..
[nl3]maybe they're numbers?
[en2]

[nl2] Come closer.
[en2]
.. isn't what I should
[nl2]be saying now!
[en2]
It's a 「Do Not Enter「
[nl2]sign.
[en2]

[nl2] The guys from earlier?
[en2]
You're the oldest
[nl2]brother!
[en2]
Oh, he caught ..
[nl2]something!
[en2]
You're the 2nd
[nl2]brother!
[en2]
It's a suspicious
[nl2]boulder. I think we
[nl3]could lift it if we[np]
[scl]work together...
[en2]
It's the monkey from
[nl2]before.
[en2]
Luck Rocks won't come
[nl2]out anymore.
[en2]

[nl2] You're the youngest!
[en2]
Ooh ooh eek!
[nl2]TL: You're late!
[nl3]What's wrong?
[en2]
What are these boards?
[en2]
The footprints stop
[nl2]here. I wonder why.
[en2]
What is this? There
[nl2]are 4 handles.
[en2]
This grass is dried
[nl2]out like a mummy.
[en2]
What a weird robot.
[nl2]It's sprinkling water
[nl3]like it's haywire.
[en2]
Something's written on
[nl2]the ground...
[en2]
Grr. Bark bark. Growl.
[en2]
You can't see what
[nl2]is written here.
[en2]
Hey!
[nl2]The crystal ball!
[en2]
It's a pipe.
[en2]
Water is pouring out.
[en2]
Now boys, don't do
[nl2]anything too
[nl3]dangerous, alright?[np]
[scl]You don't have to say
[scl]anything. I can see it
[scl]in your eyes.
[en2]
Ah, you were worried
[nl2]about me, so you
[nl3]became a ghost to come[np]
[scl]check on me?!
[en2]
It's a strange rock
[nl2]that floats up and
[nl3]down!
[en2]
Thank you for
[nl2]collecting the
[nl3]firewood, [team] Team.
[en2]
This pipe sure is in
[nl2]the way...
[en2]
What is this mark?
[en2]
The plant that
[nl2]attacked me
[nl3]was huge!...
[en2]
Huh? There's a hole.
[en2]
It's a sign!
[en2]
A treasure chest!!
[en2]
I heard from Dorothy
[nl2]that you collected the
[nl3]firewood!
[en2]
The parasite has been
[nl2]cleansed from the
[nl3]Baobab tree.
[en2]
Too bad. The chest is
[nl2]empty.
[en2]
Why is there a door
[nl2]here?
[en2]
Chirpy chirp.
[nl2]TL: You're finally
[nl3]here. From here on,[np]
[scl]the real fun starts.
[en2]
Huh? Something
[nl2]came out.
[en2]
[SP$0016]...This is... Blood!!
[nl2]... Miss Gina?!?
[en2]
Yahoo~![np]
[nl2]I can't let you
[nl3]punk kids in unless
[scl]you're all together!
[en2]
Hey, hey![np]
[nl2]If you're a
[nl3]man, come at me
[scl]one-on-one.
[en2]
People call me Crusher
[nl2]Bob. I specialize in

[en2]
Toot toot! Here
[nl2]comes the train![np] 
[nl3]It'll ruin your day 
[scl]if you get hit!
[en2]
Look! Firewood!
[en2]
The picture said
[nl2]something?
[en2]
It's a picture of
[nl2]Pirate Blue's
[nl3]grandfather.
[en2]
That control panel is
[nl2]for the ship's engine.
[en2]
...What a large
[nl2]painting.
[en2]
I wonder what he'll
[nl2]pull up.
[en2]
Did you get 6 pieces
[nl2]of firewood yet,
[nl3][team] Team?
[en2]
What is it?
[en2]
What's wrong,
[nl2]chitlins?
[en2]
Who could be sleeping
[nl2]in such a tiny bed?
[en2]
What do you 
[nl2]brats want?[np] 
[nl3]You're jealous of my
[scl]beauty so you came
[scl]to steal our oil!?
[en2]
What is this?
[nl2]It looks like some
[nl3]kind of switch...
[en2]
Your team is in charge
[nl2]of firewood.[np]
[nl3]Let's see, you need
[scl][C$2A] pieces...
[en2]

[en2]
It's a crystal ball!
[en2]
We listened to these

[nl3]the crystals... but[np]
[scl]now what?
[en2]
Oh my, firewood.
[en1]
Chirpy chirp.
[nl2]TL: Our job is
[nl3]finished now. The rest[np]
[scl]is up to you.

You get it yet?
[nl2]What are you

A bite!!!!
[en2]
Ooh ooh
[nl2]TL: This is bye-bye.

What a creepy door.

Hey, [team] Team.

[en2]
Chirp chirp.

[nl3]right into one of[np]
[scl]Maverick's traps! What
[scl]a disaster. You kids
[scl]want to save your[np]
[scl]teacher, right?
[en2]
[X$6A][SP$0306]...This robot is
[nl2]saying something?
[en2]
What a surprise!
[nl2]He's a dwarf.
[en2]
It's a cave.
[en2]
It's a large post.
[en2]
There are lots of fish
[nl2]swimming.
[en2]
It's a robot.
[nl2]...Hm? Something's
[nl3]wrong
[en2]
Didn't you hear me? I
[nl2]said I wanted the
[nl3]f-a-t boy.
[en1]
Good eye there.
[en1]
[X$6A]It's the same as the
[nl2]robot from the island.
[en2]
There's an
[nl2]entrance here.
[en2]
It's looks like an old
[nl2]mine cart.
[en2]
It's a switch that you
[nl2]can step on.
[en2]
An old mine cart.
[en2]
There's a hole for
[nl2]people here.
[en2]
The door is shut
[nl2]tightly.
[en2]
Holy cow! The robot is
[nl2]pushing a giant
[nl3]boulder this way! It's[np]

It's a giant

Chirpy chirp.

Fugofugo.

[en2]
These penguins are a

[nl3]in their own world.[np]
[scl]Let's give them some
[scl]privacy.
[en2]
These penguins aren't
[nl2]a couple yet...
[en2]
[SP$00D3]It's the male group.
[en2]
What's he doing? He
[nl2]won't get off.
[en2]
Let's set these guys
[nl2]up!
[en2]

[nl2] How about this one?
[en1]
This is a couple we
[nl2]set up.
[en2]
[SP$00D3]... This is
[nl2]very difficult to say,
[nl3]but all the other[np]
[scl]pengins have been

Things are getting

Fugo fugo.

Fugo? fugofugo.

[scl]fast, so good luck.
[scl]You'll need it.
[en2]
I'm a rolypoly bug.

Fugo fugo

Fugo fugo

[nl2] What, it didn't work?

I had extra

Good work. Let's keep

Amazing! Only one

There's a small hole.

Sorry, that pot is

It's the same guy from

Woof woof bark!!

What business do you

There's a message...

What is this gross

It's an X-Ray machine.

Did you kids find a

Hey, let's play? Wanna

[en1]
I'm Referee Jackie.
[nl2]Want to try a bout
[nl3]with Crusher Bob over[np]
[scl]there?
[en2]
Who wants to challenge
[nl2]me? Please go easy on
[nl3]me... wahahahaha!
[en2]
[X$6A]The referee was
[nl2]a woman! Now you have
[nl3]identified the second[np]
[scl]of the 3 females.
[en2]
You busted us! We're
[nl2]John and Ken. But we
[nl3]know who is suspicious[np]
[scl]in town!
[en2]
[X$6A]This one's a
[nl2]fake?! Which means..
[nl3][SP$0121]He's a[np]
[scl]plant!?
[en2]
[X$6A]This kid lives here?
[en2]
There, there, stop
[nl2]crying... What can we
[nl3]do to make him stop[np]
[scl]crying?
[en2]
It looks dicey out
[nl2]there, so watch
[nl3]yourselves.
[en2]
Jeez!
[nl2]Embarrassed again!
[en2]
Did you find Mr.
[nl2]Smith?
[en2]
It's so dangerous
[nl2]outside I can't get
[nl3]any work done! ..What[np]
[scl]do you want?
[en2]
Sp... So spice!!
[nl2]Water!!
[en2]
Haven't you seen a
[nl2]creepy plant somewhere
[nl3]else?
[en2]
It seems like this
[nl2]leads to the cave.
[en2]
It's the old man from
[nl2]the management office?
[en2]
[X$6A]Someone came
[nl2]out of the plant! Huh?
[nl3]It's Mr.[np]
[scl]Smith...[SP$0121]Then
[scl]who did we meet in the
[scl]cave earlier?!
[en2]
We were too late! The
[nl2]key to the cave is
[nl3]already gone. Who[np]
[scl]could have done this?
[en2]
Find the plant who
[nl2]turned into a person!
[nl3]He must be in the[np]
[scl]village, I'm sure of
[scl]it!
[en2]
Someone told you I
[nl2]would be afraid of
[nl3]mice? That's silly.
[en2]
I didn't cower in fear
[nl2]at the sound of a
[nl3]mouse's squeak, right,[np]
[scl]tubby? Hehehe... Okay,
[scl]you want to know how
[scl]many townspeople there[np]
[scl]are? Excepting myself
[scl]and Mr. Smith, there
[scl]are [C$2E] people and [C$24][np]
[scl]are women.
[en2]
It says, 「Smith's
[nl2]Diary.「
[en2]
There's a hole here.
[en2]
It's a loud, squeaky
[nl2]mouse.
[en2]
Man, I was working
[nl2]inside, and then Mr.
[nl3]Smith suddenly chased[np]
[scl]me out.
[en2]
Who are you kids?!
[en2]
 Grr~! Bark bark!
[nl2]Growl...
[en2]
Why is a plant growing
[nl2]here??
[en2]
A dog's corpse came
[nl2]out. The collar
[nl3]is[SP$0121] the same[np]
[scl]as the dog that
[scl]attacked us.
[en2]
There might be a prize
[nl2]for taking down Bob,
[nl3]you know.
[en2]
[SP$00D3]Wash your
[nl2]face and come back
[nl3]later. I'll take those[np]
[scl]gloves back, too!
[en1]
The ship has stopped
[nl2]safely.
[en2]
Stop right there,
[nl2]travelers! For your
[nl3]crime of kidnapping[np]
[scl]the princess, you will
[scl]be arrested and taken
[scl]to the king to receive[np]
[scl]your sentence.
[en1]
Stop right there,
[nl2]travelers! For your
[nl3]crime of kidnapping[np]
[scl]Polly, you will be
[scl]arrested and taken to
[scl]a cell to await[np]
[scl]punishment. According
[scl]to reports, there were
[scl]3 of you. Where are[np]
[scl]your friends? Someone,
[scl]go and fetch them.
[en1]
How could Polly be
[nl2]kidnapped by such dumb
[nl3]kids... well, at least[np]
[scl]now Polly should
[scl]understand that
[scl]stories of giants are[np]
[scl]nothing but lies.
[en2]
If you were just
[nl2]giants, how did you
[nl3]become tiny like us?[np]
[scl]It's unbelievable.
[en2]
I am sure you were
[nl2]giants. Maybe it was a
[nl3]bad dream.
[en2]
Maybe the reason you
[nl2]guys shrunk is the
[nl3]same reason everything[np]
[scl]around this castle is
[scl]huge...
[en2]
These stairs lead to
[nl2]Princess Polly's room.
[nl3]Without Solomon's[np]
[scl]permission you can't
[scl]enter.
[en2]
This stairway leads to
[nl2]the dungeon. Without
[nl3]Hassan's permission[np]
[scl]you may not enter.
[en2]
Criminals must not be
[nl2]allowed to escape.
[nl3]Quietly await your[np]
[scl]judgement.
[en2]
What are you doing?
[nl2]Follow Hassan's
[nl3]orders.
[en2]
Look at the creatures
[nl2]in the cell there.
[nl3]They're 「Blue Things,「[np]
[scl]giant ants.
[en2]
I've been searching
[nl2]for a way to defeat
[nl3]the 「Blue Things「 for[np]
[scl]a long time and
[scl]finally found a
[scl]solution.
[en2]
Choose who you will
[nl2]leave behind. If you
[nl3]drag your feet, the[np]
[scl]「Blue Things「 will
[scl]come and destroy us!
[en2]
Don't worry about
[nl2]whoever you leave
[nl3]behind. This dungeon[np]
[scl]is MUCH safer than the
[scl]forest.
[en2]
It's a giant ant! How
[nl2]could an ant get so
[nl3]big?
[en2]
Hassan is the greatest
[nl2]scientist in the
[nl3]kingdom.
[en2]
The forest is outside
[nl2]the castle and to the
[nl3]left.
[en2]
The king is taking a
[nl2]little nap. Don't make
[nl3]a ruckus!
[en2]
This gate leads to the
[nl2]forest.
[en2]
This gate leads to the
[nl2]「Blue Thing「 colony.
[nl3]Those without the[np]
[scl]king's permission may
[scl]not pass.
[en2]
This gate leads
[nl2]outside. The king
[nl3]forbids your passage.

[nl3]this! Hurry up and[np]
[scl]turn the lights back
[scl]on!
[en2]
After trying so hard
[nl2]to get rid of us...
[en2]
This looks like the

[en2]
Huh!?[SP$0121]
[nl2]There's been a
[nl3]reaction!
[en2]
Hey, wait a minute.

There's a switch....

It looks like a

[en2]
An energy drink?! Who
[nl2]dropped this?
[en2]
It's a giant mouse!
[nl2]Did they break the
[nl3]bridge?
[en2]
It's a tiny mouse! Did
[nl2]they break the bridge?
[en2]
It looks like a bridge
[nl2]used to be here.
[en2]
Did you find what you
[nl2]were looking for?
[en2]
I heard from my
[nl2]husband. You boys are
[nl3]incredible!
[en2]
Whose mask should I
[nl2]make next?
[en2]
I've learned my lesson...!
[en2]
I think I'll find a
[nl2]better job, for the
[nl3]sake of my boys.
[en2]
Thanks to you, I've
[nl2]opened my eyes.
[en2]
Who listens to rock
[nl2]anymore?
[en2]
Ooh, spicy~! He's not
[nl2]very smart, but just
[nl3]look at him!
[en2]
Is being beautiful a
[nl2]sin...?
[en2]
That feels great!
[en2]
This is just me
[nl2]talking, but...
[en2]
Oh, ho!
[nl2]You kids are okay!

The safe is open...

What on Earth is going

The basement of this

There's a rope.

[en2]
Hey, give it a try. We

It's a mechanical
[nl2]door. It's awfully

[scl]still be functional.
[en2]
Hey, the Patchies!
[en2]
I must be a little too
[nl2]heavy.. don't worry
[nl3]about me. You kids go[np]
[scl]on ahead, I'll be
[scl]okay.

A strange door!
[en2]
This is pretty sturdy!
[en2]
It's a huge log!
[en2]
What does this say...
[en2]
What happened? Your
[nl2]teacher came rushing
[nl3]out.
[en2]
[X$6A]The.. the
[nl2]picture talked! It's a
[nl3]ghost!!
[en2]
Hmph, don't get weird
[nl2]ideas in your head. I
[nl3]wouldn't want to team[np]
[scl]up with scum like you
[scl]in 100 years.
[en2]
You want me to go with
[nl2]you? Don't be stupid!
[nl3]A captain goes down[np]
[scl]with his ship.
[en2]
The wall here seems new.
[en2]
Shh! Quiet!
[en2]
It's an old diary.
[en2]
Hey, is that funny?
[en2]
My grandfather's
[nl2]clooock~ was too tall
[nl3]for the sheellf~ so it[np]
[scl]stooood~ nooo~ mooore~.
[en2]
I've been waiting!
[en2]
There are stairs up
[nl2]here.
[en2]
I'm so excited.
[en2]
Haha, I got you good!
[nl2]These pop when they're
[nl3]hit from above. They[np]
[scl]don't hurt, so don't
[scl]worry.
[en2]
This is my friend, a
[nl2]migratory bird. He was
[nl3]just coming to visit[np]
[scl]me. Hey, say hello.
[en1]
Something came out of
[nl2]the grave.
[en1]
[F2]Received
[nl2]mysterious, old
[nl3]photograph!
[en1]
This sure is an old
[nl2]photo.. who could
[nl3]those people be..? And[np]
[scl]what is he holding?
[scl]Could it be.. the
[scl]people in town might[np]
[scl]know more.
[en2]
This was a lively town
[nl2]until the bandits
[nl3]attacked. Now our[np]
[scl]crops won't even grow!
[en2]
The grave off on its
[nl2]own is where Indio,
[nl3]the leader of the[np]
[scl]mountain bandits,
[scl]rests. He was arrested
[scl]right away, but we[np]
[scl]never found the
[scl]「town's treasure「...
[en2]
Hmm, it seems like
[nl2]this woman's child was
[nl3]kidnapped by Indio's[np]
[scl]daughter, who lives
[scl]out East of Death
[scl]Lake. But Death Lake[np]
[scl]is scary, so I'm
[scl]afraid to go... would
[scl]you go in my place?[np]
[scl]I'm sure Indio's
[scl]daughter wouldn't hurt
[scl]the child, but just to[np]
[scl]be safe... The
[scl]entrance to Death Lake
[scl]is guarded by my guard[np]
[scl]dog, but don't worry.
[scl]Just toss him a bone
[scl]and he'll fall right[np]
[scl]asleep.
[en1]
I'm the sheriff 'round
[nl2]these parts. That
[nl3]woman seems to be in[np]
[scl]trouble.
[en2]
Did you find the
[nl2]child? He's with
[nl3]Indio's daughter past[np]
[scl]「Death Lake.「
[en2]
What?! You lost the
[nl2]food? Fine, take this.
[en1]
Please, save my child~!
[nl2]He would never wander
[nl3]into 「Death Lake「 on[np]
[scl]his own, so I'm sure
[scl]Indio's daughter must
[scl]have kidnapped him![np]
[scl]Her father was the
[scl]leader of the bandits,
[scl]after all.
[en2]
Hey little travelers.
[nl2]What's up? This town
[nl3]used to be a pirate[np]
[scl]port.
[en2]
That old thing?
[en2]
It's an air balloon!
[nl2]There's a basket at
[nl3]the bottom.
[en2]
Did you boys get rid
[nl2]of the mutant flowers?
[nl3]Wow! This boy was[np]
[scl]trying to come here
[scl]and got lost... I
[scl]brought him here, but[np]
[scl]we were trapped. Now
[scl]he can go home safely.
[en2]
People in town always
[nl2]bad mouth Miss Sisko,
[nl3]but she's not a bad[np]
[scl]person! She teaches me
[scl]lots of stuff!
[en2]
Don't mind what he
[nl2]said. The people of
[nl3]this town think my[np]
[scl]father stole their
[scl]「treasure「 many years
[scl]ago. But, I believe my[np]
[scl]father is innocent.
[scl]Still, no one will
[scl]even visit his grave.[np]
[scl]Only his pet crow
[scl]keeps him company. I
[scl]have a favor to ask[np]
[scl]you boys. Could you
[scl]please take these
[scl]flowers to his grave?
[en1]
He didn't mean
[nl2]anything by it.
[en2]
Did you take flowers
[nl2]to my father's grave?
[nl3]I'm sure the crow will[np]
[scl]remember me if you
[scl]show him the flowers.
[en2]
Thank you! Thank you!
[nl2]It was Miss Sisko,
[nl3]wasn't it? The apple[np]
[scl]doesn't fall far from
[scl]the tree, does it?
[en2]
Please, guys! Tell
[nl2]everyone that Miss
[nl3]Sisko isn't a bad[np]
[scl]person!
[en2]
Thanks, you guys! If
[nl2]anything else goes
[nl3]wrong, be sure to come[np]
[scl]back.

[SP$0119]Caw caw!
[nl2]TL: No one is getting
[nl3]near this grave!
[en2]
It says: The hero who
[nl2]protected our town,
[nl3]Christopher Benson,[np]
[scl]rests here.
[en2]
It says: 「Grave of the
[nl2]Super Evil Bandit,
[nl3]Indio.「 What..?
[en2]
Something came out of
[nl2]the grave. It looks
[nl3]like a picture.
[en2]
This is a mysterious
[nl2]house without an
[nl3]entrance. Speaking of[np]
[scl]mysterious houses, it
[scl]is said that in the
[scl]middle of the night,[np]
[scl]you can hear clocks
[scl]ringing in the mansion
[scl]in the East. Scary[np]
[scl]stuff, right?
[en2]
Things were so much
[nl2]better back then. We
[nl3]were pirates and the[np]
[scl]grass was green. Then
[scl]the bandits took our
[scl]「treasure「 and it went[np]
[scl]straight to pot...
[en2]
This is the only water
[nl2]in town.. I should've
[nl3]listened to Indio and[np]
[scl]dug more wells...
[en2]
A long time ago I
[nl2]thought about making a
[nl3]digging machine, but I[np]
[scl]lost the blueprints,
[scl]so that's just a pile
[scl]of junk. Take it if[np]
[scl]you want it.
[en2]
This dog is in the
[nl2]way...
[en2]
The dog fell fast
[nl2]asleep after eating! I
[nl3]don't think he'll be[np]
[scl]up any time soon.
[en2]
It's a dog food dish.
[en2]
[F2]Received flowers
[nl2]from Miss Sisko!

The 「time room「 is in
[nl2]a locked mansion. The
[nl3]old woman who lives[np]
[scl]next door has the
[scl]keys.
[en2]
There's a picture here.
[en2]
You guys want to see
[nl2]inside the mansion
[nl3]next door?
[en2]
A long time ago, Indio
[nl2]and my husband had
[nl3]some project going on[np]
[scl]in the mansion next
[scl]door.
[en2]
We're the pirate
[nl2]Patchie Brothers! You
[nl3]guys are pretty sad to[np]
[scl]fall into our trap.
[scl]Want out? If you want
[scl]set free, guess who is[np]
[scl]the oldest.
[en2]
I told you guys to
[nl2]stay out of here! I
[nl3]gave you your honey,[np]
[scl]didn't I?
[en2]
It'll take a lot of
[nl2]firewood to heat up
[nl3]this giant pot.
[en2]
It's sort of sad to
[nl2]see our hard work go
[nl3]up in flames like[np]
[scl]this...
[en2]
The fire went out. I
[nl2]don't think the
[nl3]cooking finished.

It seems a pirate

Listen to this! The

[en2]
It's covered with
[nl2]spider webs now, but
[nl3]maybe they used it[np]
[scl]back when they were
[scl]pirates.
[en2]
It's a wooden bucket.
[nl2]Is it used for
[nl3]cleaning?
[en2]
This is so~ old!

Granny's chair, I

Ribbit.

My child just loves
[nl2]Miss Sisko's classes.
[nl3]She's such a good[np]
[scl]teacher.
[en2]
Thanks to Sisko's
[nl2]father, this town has
[nl3]plenty of water.
[en2]
Indio and Christopher
[nl2]Benson saved our town.
[nl3]Their graves always[np]
[scl]have visitors.
[en2]
My husband was a great
[nl2]man. His grave is in
[nl3]the cemetery near[np]
[scl]town. Go see him if
[scl]you'd like.
[en2]
I'm so happy to live
[nl2]in this beautiful
[nl3]town!
[en2]
The fancy graves in
[nl2]the west are for
[nl3]Benson and Indio, men[np]
[scl]who protected the
[scl]village against
[scl]bandits a long time[np]
[scl]ago.
[en2]
I'm a teacher in this
[nl2]town. My name is
[nl3]Sisko. Where are you[np]
[scl]boys from? If you
[scl]don't hurry back, your
[scl]teacher will be[np]
[scl]worried! Teachers are
[scl]always concerned for
[scl]their children, so be[np]
[scl]good and go back soon.
[scl]But it's strange, when
[scl]I see you kids, I feel[np]
[scl]like this isn't the
[scl]first time we've met.
[en1]
Oh no! Class is about
[nl2]to start!
[en1]
Are you playing?
[en2]
Class is starting
[nl2]soon.
[en2]
Class is starting
[nl2]soon!!

Are you studying?

Miss Sisko is in the

[nl2]class!
[en2]
Oh my, you kids. Hurry
[nl2]up and head home, your
[nl3]teacher must be[np]
[scl]worried sick!
[en2]
Look, look! It's the
[nl2]home of my dreams!
[en2]
Everything used to be
[nl2]better... isn't the
[nl3]kind of thing to be[np]
[scl]saying all the time!

Look how small it

Meep meep!

[nl3]spray me again, aren't[np]
[scl]you!?

He's playing like some
[nl2]yarn.
[en2]
It's the grave of
[nl2]someone from town.
[en2]
It's Benson's ghost!
[nl2]It looks like it wants
[nl3]to say something...
[en2]
It's huge! It must
[nl2]belong to her father.
[en2]
What long arrows~.
[en2]
It's so pretty. It's
[nl2]made from feathers.
[en2]
It's made from large
[nl2]feathers.
[en2]
I've seen this before
[nl2]somewhere...
[en2]
A pirate flag! But, it
[nl2]looks like a cheap
[nl3]souvenir.
[en2]
Ooh, treasure chests!
[en2]
It's made from gold!
[nl2]We're rich!
[en2]
Could this be...
[nl2]Pirate...
[en2]
This could be what
[nl2]Blue and mom...
[en2]
This tombstone is the
[nl2]only one without a

[en2]
...Oops? The switch
[nl2]won't go back.

Did you find all the
[nl2]firewood yet? I,
[nl3]Dorothy of Girl Power[np]
[scl]Team, have offered to
[scl]make food for you
[scl]peons, but I can't do[np]
[scl]it if you won't bring
[scl]me firewood!!!
[en2]
What, you kids again?
[nl2]You can't enter the
[nl3]Archive Room while[np]
[scl]Hassan is out.
[en2]
This is the entrance
[nl2]to the castle's back
[nl3]garden. It's a secret[np]
[scl]place that no one
[scl]except the king, not
[scl]even Polly, can enter.
[en2]
It's a tape recorder.
[en2]
Maybe we can record
[nl2]animal noises.

[scl]should help yourself
[scl]to them?
[en2]
There is a trick to
[nl2]teamwork. That trick

How long will it take

If you want to know
[nl2]about teamwork, ask
[nl3]our leader.
[en2]
It's a big pot. Can it
[nl2]be moved?
[en2]
They're sort of wet,
[nl2]huh. If you walk a bit
[nl3]they should dry. Don't[np]

Thank you. It seems

There's a wooden box

[nl2]blocking my view.
[en2]
The one among you who
[nl2]likes building things
[nl3]is...
[en2]
You look raring to go!
[nl2]Next is Max, the
[nl3]stout!
[en1]
An adult is dressed up
[nl2]like a pirate~!
[en2]
Oh, welcome home,
[nl2]dear. What's the
[nl3]hurry?
[en2]
Lord Benson! Tell them
[nl2]to become pirates!
[en2]
This plant is in the
[nl2]way.
[en2]
It's a plant, but it's
[nl2]moving... Look closely
[nl3]at the root there. DID[np]
[scl]YOU LOOK CLOSELY?!
[en2]
Oh, a sandbag!
[en2]
Oh my! Shocking!
[nl2]And lastly, Jack,
[nl3]the beanstalk.
[en1]
Hey, [team] Team. Have
[nl2]you ever looked
[nl3]underwater? It's[np]
[scl]amazing! Since we've
[scl]come all the way to
[scl]camp, we've gotta have[np]
[scl]fun!
[en2]
I'm a man, so I won't
[nl2]cry about it. If I
[nl3]find them again, I'll[np]
[scl]let you guys borrow
[scl]them. Hahaha!
[en2]
The water is pretty
[nl2]deep here, so be
[nl3]careful!
[en2]
My heart is wide like
[nl2]the ocean! I'll let
[nl3]Max use my goggles.[np]
[scl]Hahahaha!
[en2]
You really saved our
[nl2]skins, [team] Team.
[en2]
I'm huungry~. Fee~ed us~.
[nl2]Sing with me!
[en2]
Ahh, I'm pooped.
[en2]
Isn't lunch ready yet?
[en2]
I'm huuungry~. Fee~ed meee.
[en2]
Hehe, Dorothy was mad
[nl2]at me earlier!
[en2]
Dorothy got mad at me!
[nl2]But really...
[en2]
Are you using those
[nl2]soccer shoes?
[en2]
I caught a fish with
[nl2]my bare hands earlier,
[nl3]so now my hands stink.
[en2]
You guys are in the
[nl2]way of my special
[nl3]lunch preparations!
[en2]
Please prove Indio's
[nl2]innocence!
[en2]
No one has lived in
[nl2]this house for ages.
[nl3]It's a mysterious[np]
[scl]house... which reminds
[scl]me...
[en2]
Where were you guys?!
[nl2]Miss Gina was looking
[nl3]for you! Did you run[np]
[scl]into her?
[en2]
You guys are late,
[nl2][team] Team! You were
[nl3]off doing weird boy[np]
[scl]stuff, weren't you?
[en2]
Hey, what happened to
[nl2]the rest of your team?
[en2]
For now just... C...
[nl2]C... Calm down... Or
[nl3]not.
[en2]
You are really going
[nl2]to save Miss Gina?
[en2]
Hey, a monkey! It
[nl2]seems scared.
[en2]
Shaka shaka
[nl2]TL: We're army ants.
[nl3]We won't go down with[np]
[scl]a huff and a puff.
[en2]
What could it beeee.
[nl2]What could it beeeeeee.
[en2]
You have something to
[nl2]tell me?
[en2]
Huzzah! The robot
[nl2]stopped moving!
[en2]
Oh, a big hole opened
[nl2]up!
[en2]
This flat thing...
[nl2]must be Hassan.
[en2]
Just what are you
[nl2]ogling over there?
[nl3]Come closer if you[np]
[scl]want to talk.
[en2]
What are you staring
[nl2]at? Want to try Papa
[nl3]Jam's 「Kick and[np]
[scl]Smash!「 game? 1 play,
[scl]1 Luck Rock. You up
[scl]for it?
[en2]
Hurry up and kick the
[nl2]ball!
[en2]
What is this machine?
[nl2]Did that Jim-look-alike
[nl3]build it?
[en2]
What is this machine?
[nl2]It looks like a goal.
[en2]
...Not yet.
[en2]
A soccer ball.
[en2]
You've run out of Luck
[nl2]Rocks. I'll give one
[nl3]back to you.
[en2]
Hurry! Run away! You
[nl2]can't defeat this
[nl3]「Queen「 with those[np]
[scl]items!
[en2]
Don't worry about me,
[nl2]look carefully at the
[nl3]「Queen「! Her eyes are[np]
[scl]her weak points!
[en2]
Wh.. What a giant ant!
[nl2]Our items won't make a
[nl3]dent.
[en2]
Thank you for saving
[nl2]us.
[en2]
Incredible. I've never
[nl2]seen such an
[nl3]impressive battle...[np]
[scl]You're amazing.
[en2]
Anything's worth a
[nl2]try, I guess. I can't
[nl3]believe you kids[np]
[scl]thought of that.
[en2]
Hurray! I didn't think
[nl2]it would go so well.
[en2]
This garden will get
[nl2]lonely.
[en2]
That ball gave life to
[nl2]this garden... alas,
[nl3]there is nothing for[np]
[scl]it.
[en2]
Are you leaving so
[nl2]soon? Polly will be
[nl3]disappointed.
[en2]
Polly isn't in her
[nl2]room.
[en2]
What happened to
[nl2]Polly? Oh, she is
[nl3]safe? I'm so relieved.
[en2]
It's our picture! This
[nl2]was painted in blue,
[nl3]red, and then green, I[np]
[scl]think.
[en2]
Welc...
[nl2]Oh, the kids who
[nl3]invaded our kingdom.[np]
[scl]Are you supposed to be
[scl]fuddling around here?
[en2]
What's wrong,
[nl2]children? If you're
[nl3]tired, feel free to[np]
[scl]rest in my inn. Hassan
[scl]will take care of the
[scl]bill, so don't worry[np]
[scl]about it.
[en2]
Fugofugo
[nl2]TL: Can you kick?
[nl3]I'll let 1 kicker[np]
[scl]through. How about
[scl]it?[np]
[scl][X$6A]    Let me pass.
[scl]    I'll come back.[X$68]
[en1]
Look!! You boys were
[nl2]telling the truth!!
[nl3]Everything outside the[np]
[scl]castle is returning to
[scl]normal.
[en2]
...Something is moving.
[en2]
Ah! This is an eagle
[nl2]egg!
[en2]
Travelers, thank you!
[nl2]Princess Polly has
[nl3]safely returned to the[np]
[scl]castle.
[en2]
Oh! You made it back!
[nl2]I could tell you kids
[nl3]weren't just any old[np]
[scl]kids.
[en2]
Thank you for saving
[nl2]the other soldiers.
[nl3]Everyone is praying[np]
[scl]for your safety.
[en2]
Did you have any
[nl2]trouble with the 「Blue
[nl3]Ants「? How did you[np]
[scl]manage to defeat them?
[en2]
I heard you boys
[nl2]defeated the 「Queen.「
[nl3]I sincerely thank you.
[en2]
You kids are quite
[nl2]impressive. We adults
[nl3]were at a total loss,[np]
[scl]but you managed to
[scl]save us.
[en2]
I heard. You guys are
[nl2]pretty good. Why don't
[nl3]you stay here and join[np]
[scl]the army?
[en2]
Did you already see
[nl2]the king? I'm sure
[nl3]he'll have a special[np]
[scl]prize for you.
[en2]
Thank you, [team]
[nl2]Team. 
[nl3]What? You want to know[np]
[scl]how I know your name?
[scl]Ahaha...haha...
[en2]
I'm the one who lost
[nl2]the 「Soldier Blue「
[nl3]inside the 「Blue[np]
[scl]Things'「 nest.
[scl]Remember me?
[en2]
Very impressive, boys.
[nl2]I hope my children
[nl3]grow up to be like you[np]
[scl]all.
[en2]
Children who know no
[nl2]fear, as long as I
[nl3]live, I will never[np]
[scl]forget what [team]
[scl]Team did for my
[scl]soldiers.
[en2]
Thank you for saving
[nl2]me in their nest. You
[nl3]were like angels.
[en2]
Thank you for saving
[nl2]me in their nest. I'll
[nl3]never forget you.
[en2]
Thank you, [team]
[nl2]Team. If it weren't
[nl3]for you, I wouldn't be[np]
[scl]standing here right
[scl]now.
[en2]
Good job coming back
[nl2]in one piece. I don't
[nl3]want to think what[np]
[scl]would have happened to
[scl]me if you hadn't been
[scl]there, [team] Team.
[en2]
Hurray! I'm shocked
[nl2]that you boys managed
[nl3]to defeat the queen[np]
[scl]all alone!
[en2]
Thank you, travelers.
[nl2]We're terribly sorry
[nl3]for treating you like[np]
[scl]criminals. In the
[scl]confusion, we may have
[scl]overreacted.
[en2]
Oh, you're back! How
[nl2]was the buster cannon?
[nl3]I knew you kids could[np]
[scl]handle it!
[en2]
Oooh, the king's
[nl2]private garden... I
[nl3]had no idea... Well,[np]
[scl]it's a nice garden, I
[scl]guess.
[en2]
...Huh?
[nl2]What is this giant
[nl3]ball...?
[en2]
Is something wrong
[nl2]with the crystal ball?
[en2]
What are you saying?!
[nl2]That's...!! You're
[nl3]saying that everything[np]
[scl]outside the castle
[scl]seems huge because WE
[scl]shrunk?!?
[en2]
I heard what you said.
[nl2]Go on and take this
[nl3]「reward.「
[en2]
What will you do? The
[nl2]crystal ball is to
[nl3]large to fit through[np]
[scl]the entrance...
[en2]
The king is sort of
[nl2]lazy. He always
[nl3]delegates his problems[np]
[scl]to others... ah, but
[scl]don't let him know I
[scl]told you.
[en2]
How can you move this
[nl2]giant ball?
[en2]
I wonder if we can
[nl2]combine our power to
[nl3]lift this ball...
[en2]
Did you learn the
[nl2]eagle egg's pattern?
[en2]
I wonder if Solomon's
[nl2]idea will really work
[nl3]and the eagle will[np]
[scl]carry it off...
[en2]
So you have to paint
[nl2]an egg pattern onto
[nl3]this ball...
[en2]
What are you waiting
[nl2]for? Hurry up and find
[nl3]an egg!
[en2]
Oh, the heroes are
[nl2]back. Sounds like you

[en2]
Chirpy chirp!
[nl2]TL: Wow, the 「Yellow
[nl3]Crystal「!! Good job. I[np]
[scl]wonder if this ball
[scl]was to blame for

[scl]forms and moving
[scl]around.
[en2]
Chirpy chirp.
[nl2]TL: The 「Green
[nl3]Crystal.「 Good job. I[np]
[scl]guess this crystal
[scl]ball shrunk that whole

[nl3]the lever on the side,[np]
[scl]the ship won't move.

Ooh ooh!

Ooh ooh!

It's a huge steering

Get a move on! You

[en2]
How long are you going
[nl2]to keep me waiting?
[nl3]You boys don't have[np]
[scl]any manners at all.
[en2]
Come on, hurry up! Are
[nl2]we ever going to
[nl3]leave?
[en2]
Ooh ooh!
[nl2]TL: Why did the little
[nl3]girl get so big? That[np]
[scl]was my spot...
[en2]
Chirp chirpy
[nl2]TL: That girl is
[nl3]Polly, isn't she? When[np]
[scl]did she get here?
[en2]
It's a bird nest.
[en2]
It's a big lever.
[en2]
It's a lever for the
[nl2]ship's engine.
[en2]
It's a fancy chair.
[en2]
What's with this ship?
[nl2]The outside seems old,
[nl3]but the inside looks[np]

[en2]
[SP$0119]Caww!
[nl2]TL: I'm glad I found

[en2]
Ooh aah!

It's a swarm of

Wow, look at this huge

This SOS looks

This SOS led us to

Hey, kids shouldn't be

Weren't you told to go

[nl3]get in the way of our[np]
[scl]investigation out
[scl]here.
[en2]
You need something?
[nl2]We're not here to play

We've captured some
