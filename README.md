# Marvelous-SFC-EN
Translation repository for Marvelous: Another Treasure Island for the Super Famicom

Included are all the files related to the v1.05 english release made on romhacking.net

Building the project is accomplished by first copying the original japanese rom file into the "ORIGINAL ROM" folder and renaming it to "base.sfc". You can name it whatever you like as long as the "./Build/MBuild.MBXML" file is modified to match. Once this is accomplished, you can use my MBuild (will add the repository soon) tool to create the final release.

MBuild can output the final SFC file for testing, as well as .ips and .xdelta patches.
