base.sfc : This is a clean, original Marvelous ROM File.

Any of the bin files are meant to be named according to their final location in the ROM.
I got kind of lazy with some of this. You can check the MBuild.XML file for more information.

the information below is incomplete.

For Example: x00000000_

After the underscore, the type of file is named:
LZR = This data will be compressed and overwrite the data in the specified location.
LZI = This data will be compressed and be inserted to the specified location.
REP	= This data will overwrite any data in this location.
INS	= This data will be inserted in the specified location. Nothing overwritten.

title logo lines are 3F (40) tiles in length

The name after the PC File location and the type of change is just to make it easier to identify.

Note: LZR Type may include the max size of data before it will need to be relocated.
